my concern with AI (as the term is used now) is that it extends our capabilities beyond our understanding in a way that
(usually) doesn't contribute back to our understanding in any meaningful way. There is greater potential for 
intellectual stagnation in fields that depend heavily on AI as a way to make advancements in their capability.
It is a technology, like most new tech it seems, that gives a short-term boost in productivity in exchange for long-term
progress.
