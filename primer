<h1>purpose</h1><p>
what is the purpose of this primer?
a guide on how to live better.
what does 'better' mean?
To have a healthy ideal and effectively strive towards it.
what is a healthy ideal?
an ideal is one that is satisfying to work towards rather than destructive.
Something that starts out healthy may not stay that way.
it is probably one you chose yourself rather than being foisted upon you from outside.
<p>
what is necessary for effective striving?
depends on the ideal, but some things will probably help no matter what you're going for.
The human condition necessitates that we strive towards a certain class of ideals which have a similar shape.

<p>
In a way that leads to self-satisfaction
Is the value of a life determined in the day-to-day of living it? or at the end?
Perhaps it is a life that leads to a strong sense of self while living it.
<p>
I don't know what the purpose of life is, nor even the purpose of my life.
But I have a sense that who I am could be enhanced.
I could be <b>more</b> myself with a little training and thought.
I have a little insight into the direction I want to push.
Along the way I hope to find a more clear vision.
<p>
I have a sneaking suspicion that the mental model I consciously hold of myself doesn't quite align with my unconscious model.
The result is that I, sometimes suddenly, realize I've gotten what I wanted and I hate it.

<h1>primer</h1><p>
a philosophical journey through the <a href="anxiety">:anxiety</a> of death, guilt, and meaninglessness that leads to the will towards existence.
The foundation of the power to exist whcih lays in the first tools (the mind, body, community).
<h1></h1><p>
I believe that <a href="#essence">:what I do determines who I am</a>.
As an existential being (a being of existence) the 'kind' of being I become is the result of the kind of actions I take, and the extent of by being, that is, the degree to which I can influence the world, is a question of power. 
Without power, you can do nothing <code>6.42</code>
<p>
Whether that power is knowledge of the physical world (scientific, probably), physical strength, or social influence.
<p>
The collection of power is not an end unto itself. Eventually we all die and our power drops to zero. It cannot be taken with us, but the extent to which we affected the world survicves as proof of our existence.
The buddhists call this kind of power <a href="#jewel">:wisdom</a> and call the correct [:expression] of that compassion.

<h1>a theory of practical knowledge</h1><p>
practical knowledge (pk) is determined by what can be effected by knowing it.
pk is context dependent, since K can be distributed and has a certain quality of depth.
I make pizza some times. I've made dough, mixing flour with water. Do I know how to make pizza dough?
Is it valid to say 'going to the store to buy dough' is a valid way to make dough?
Knowledge in the practical sense shouldn't be affected by the semantics of the word 'make'. In the end, I have dough.

<h1>:x Things to do</h1><p>
There's a ton of things to do!
<p>
To start with, are you in shape? If not, the journey from being out of shape or even moderately in shape to being in shape can be a wondrous journey!
No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable. -Socrates
Have you read East of Eden, Goethe, the Odyssey, Harry Potter, the Dresden Files, The Magic Treehouse? There are a million books out there waiting for you to read them and they are filled with magic and wonder.
A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one –George R.R. Martin
Have you tried making things? How about a quilt for yourself or for someone you know and care about? How about a book or a short story? A video game? Friendship bracelet? Butter? Cookies? From projects big to small there's always something that you can make, personal and heartfelt, that will make you feel like you've accomplished something and may make you or someone you care about feel a little warmer inside.
That's the thing with handmade items. They still have the person's mark on them, and when you hold them, you feel less alone. -Aimee Bender
While traveling the world may not be a real option for everyone, there's always things to see and explore. A walk down the street, a hike in the woods, a view from a tower or a hilltop. There's beauty all over the world and it doesn't take the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower to find it.
For that matter, how many times have you sat in the grass and done nothing? -Scrubs
What foods have you tried? Have you had pho? Pigs feet? A soufflé? Flan? There's a whole world of cuisines out there with hidden goodness and questionable choices just waiting for you to try! For an even bigger challenge, try making it!
Cooking is all about people. Food is maybe the only universal thing that really has the power to bring everyone together. No matter what culture, everywhere around the world, people eat together. -Guy Fiere
How about trying to help others out? When was the last time you volunteered? Animals shelters almost always need help of some kind. Food pantries provide for some of the most vulnerable in our society. Libraries often host tutoring and teaching opportunities so you can help educate and grow the next generation.
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. -Mahatma Gandhi
If none of these appeal to you then send me a message! Let's find something that works for you! It's a wonderful, terrible, scary, and exhilarating world out there!

<h1>:x essence vs existence</h1><p>
Do we do good things because we are good? or are we good because we do good things?
<p>
<h1>:x jewel in the lotus</h1><p>
Buddhist symbol of wisdom and compassion.
<p>
Wisdom here means effectively manifest your intent through skillful means. You can correctly predict the consequences of your actions.
<p>
Compassion means loving-kindness expressed to all sentient beings. The intent you choose to manifest is benevolent.
what is called wisdom I would call power.
<p>
<h1>:x nihilism</h1><p>
in diamond age, nihilism would be considered the rejection of societal value, which is less complete than the intended solution. As a negation, nihilism only exists in relation to the want of value. It only makes sense if the soul is essence, and that essence is empty. A soul of existence becomes what it does, so nihilism only becomes true in the case of suicide???
<p>
<h1>inbox</h1><p>
how do we construct a life of consistent wholesomeness and value in the absence of a faith-based epistemology (aka religion) when, without faith's ability to pointedly ignore the problem: namely that death, guilt and meaninglessness are structurally inherent in the agent-arena relationship from which we derive value.
