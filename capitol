<h3>Advice on seeking capitol from a friend</h3><p>
You need a minimum viable team of at least three people:
<ul>
<li>someone connected to the problem space (domain expert)
</li>
<li>someone who knows business (MBA)
</li>
<li>someone who can implement the idea (engineering)
</li></ul><p>
the reputation and track record of the engineer is paramount. As are team dynamics. VC is very interested in the ability to build teams.
One way to preserve reputation is to allow a mourning period of at least one year after a funding failure
Funds are usually dispersed by powers of ten. For example the first round may give 50k for an mvp, which if delivered would receive 500k to develop a product and 5M to go to market.
'Dry powder' is extra funds set aside by investors in order to protect their initial investment.
<p>
Running through the steps with a successful exit (anything other than bankrupcy) is huge for the resume as it makes you part of 'the club'.
<p>
explicitly de-risk your operation in the business plan.
4 kinds of risk:
<ul>
<li>technical - handled by the engineer
</li>
<li>market - handled by sales/domain expert
</li>
<li>execution - handled by business guy
</li>
<li>team - handled by teamwork
Have each team address their area, and work together on the presentation in order to show low team risk
</li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>good to enter a not completely new market and shoot for the middle (in terms of size)
</li>
<li>team risk is big, reduced by track record and having each member present themselves orthogonally and cooperatively.
</li>
<li>the biggest part of the business plan is how the money will be spent.
</li>
<li>don't ask for too little
</li>
<li>the core team has to agree on the purpose of the venture and monetization scheme early on.
</li>
<li>each stage is successively less risky: idea, widget prime, established install base. Hence they will ask for a lesser
    cut.
</li>
<li>you want them to ask 'why didn't you go to the bank?' The answer is &quot;we are entering a period of exponential growth
    which the banks will not lend to&quot;
</li>
<li>advisory board: 1-2 mentors for each role. VC will talk to them, not the team.
</li>
<li>VC and grants (non-diluatory) are mutually exclusive. DO NOT pursue both at the same time. The paperwork is too much. 
    The investors are fueled by greed in one, and ego in the other.
</li>
<li>they want to see that you are 'all in' since they are totally committed by putting up money
