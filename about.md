Hello Internet! My name is Caeman Toombs and I am a computer science undergrad at North Carolina State University.  I have a particular interest in artificial intelligence and applications of cognitive science.

## Experience

Outside of schoolwork I have been involved in a variety of projects that showcase my technical ability. Here are a few of the best documented that I am allowed to share publically.

### Supercomputer proof of concept using low-end hardware
The purpose of this project was to learn the process of setting up a net of compute nodes and to write some basic program to demonstrate parallel processing.
This was completed as an indepdendant project during miniterm at [NCSSM](https://www.ncssm.edu/).

I will post a write-up of the project soon.

### M
This is a music management utilitiy I wrote that manages a list of URLs and downloads them using [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).
It was originally written as a bash script and I am in the process of making it pure python, since youtube-dl is pure python.
I am also trying to add album cover support and library-wide gain balancing. I don't believe the current version on github works, which is not very professional, but I have more important things to work on.

[Here](https://github.com/toombs-caeman/M/) is the project.

### Three Wishes
This is an android version of the iOS app [Three Wishes for a Meaningful Life ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/three-wishes-for-meaningful/id580025118)published by [sentosa](http://sentosa.us/).

Right now it is a very rough prototype, but the plan is to eventually publish this on google play.
