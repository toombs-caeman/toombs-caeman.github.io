Hello Internet! My name is Caeman Toombs and I am a computer science undergrad at North Carolina State University.  I have a particular interest in artificial intelligence and applications of cognitive science.

## Experience

Outside of schoolwork I have been involved in a variety of projects that showcase my technical ability. Here are a few of the best documented that I am allowed to share publically.

### Supercomputer proof of concept using low-end hardware
The purpose of this project was to learn the process of setting up a net of compute nodes and to write some basic program to demonstrate parallel processing.
This was completed as an indepdendant project during miniterm at [NCSSM](https://www.ncssm.edu/).

I will post a write-up of the project soon.
