<h3>Fearful Words</h3><p>
Few people will not abide liars, the weak willed, or idiots in serious conversation. The habits of speech common in
these types of people take power away from their words. These habits all have fear as a common root.
<p>
<ol>
<li>The fear of being left out leads to a desire to look good and to be affirmed. This can lead to one-upmanship,
    self-aggrandising lies, a patronizing tone, and fake listening while really preparing what to say next.
</li>
<li>The fear of being wrong leads to a desire to always be right. This leads to aggressive convincing and kills true
    listening and learning.
</li>
<li>The fear of being disliked leads to people pleasing. This leads to yes-men type behavior which restricts you to a 
    passive role in the conversation.
</li>
<li>The fear of hurting someone's feelings leads to the perpetual need to make things right, which can lead to 
    withholding of useful information, and obstructs real solutions.
</li></ol><p>
These four fears lead to seven habits which make it difficult to be around people who have them.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Gossiping, or speaking ill of someone who is absent, destroys your own reputation. Quickly everyone will realize that
    this person will be speaking ill behind their back as soon as they leave.
</li>
<li>Judging, not as careful evaluation, but condemning, makes it hard to take your words at face value, since your
    opinion is heavily colored by your prejudice
<ul>
<li>what they say comes loaded, so it's difficult to take at face value
</li></ul><li>Negativity is just hard to be around all of the time
</li>
<li>complaining can start viral misery
<ul>
<li>forgetting gratitude, which is important to a happy life
</li></ul><li>Excuses, excuses. Those that never accept responsibility for anything are full of shit.
</li>
<li>Embellishing or lying makes makes nuance hard to express when you want to, and make people question everything you
    say after a while. No one is interested in listening to a liar.
</li>
<li>dogmatism, or to confuse opinions and facts, again makes it hard for people to take your word.

<h2>Intro</h2><p>
The gnosis is play, or the dream trance
</li>
<li>the beginners mind
</li>
<li>power of habit
Mastery is a quality difficult to cultivate, but which has enormous rewards both internally and externally. Mastery is
the fusion of deep functional knowledge (the result of years of practice), creative application (breaking from
established forms), and a return to the beginners mind (intuitive grasp). People who regularly experience mastery at
work are highly paid, highly regarded, and report higher job and life satisfaction. Put another way, any existing
passion you feel for your dream career/life will be chipped away unless you regularly feel like you have the autonomy
to creatively express yourself in a way that has a real impact for the people you are helping. It truly sucks if you
are a slave to someone's whim, must always follow the script, or have zero meaningful impact.
</li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>everyday joking and musing is a low level creativity. even children do this kind of simple association. It is a basic function of the brain (and essential to <a href="reality.md#memory)">memory</a>
</li>
<li>a lifetime of learning expands the playground available for creativity
</li>
<li>high level creativity requires vast knowledge and the willingness and ability to freely explore that space, connecting new ideas
</li>
<li>return to childlike creativity, but an adult mindscape (serious play)

<h2>Intro</h2><p>
The mind does not crave rest, it craves change. Do not NOT think for a moment. Be ever present or plotting
</li></ul><p>
Focus is as much about figuring out what to pay attention to as about figuring out what to leave out.

</li>
<li> purity/volume/value of information streams
</li></ul><p>
Your life is precious because it will end, so focus on the wildly important.
Death is a non-thing, only an end of the thing we call life. You will not be there to experience it when it comes,
because it is a non-experience. Why fear something that you will never experience? On the other hand, it will happen to
you. Your time is limited and so remember to spend it well. Worrying about death is a particularly stupid way to do so.
The purpose of remembering death is not to be depressed, but to serve as a reminder to focus on what you really care
about. Remember death to intensify the experience of living. This is the purpose of 'Memento Mori'.

The <sub>outcome</sub> should be framed directly in terms of the metric you chose.
<p>
The <sub>metric</sub> is the way you will measure your progress. It is demoralizing not to be able to see progress over time.
 It is also hard to be sure you </em>are<em> progressing if you don't know how to measure.
<p>
The <sub>deadline</sub> should leave plenty of time to account for unexpected hang ups, but not too far ahead. The main benefit
 behind a deadline is it gives you a way to measure how your progress stacks up to what it should be in order to hit
  your outcome at the set date. It allows you to focus on progress rather than only on the final number.
<p>
The <sub>process</sub> is how you will work towards the goal. When you first are setting your goal, it is useful to know the
 process in at least broad terms so that you can effectively estimate the required effort to complete the goal. Knowing
  the process, and therefore the (approximate) effort, will help you decide if the goal is worth it.
<p>
<sub>Desire</sub> is the 'why' of your goal.
<p>
Working on long term projects can be difficult, and sometimes it will suck so bad you won't want to continue.
 <sub>Commitment</sub> is useful to power through these times. It is a logic to temper the natural fluctuations in an emotional
  desire to complete the task.
<p>
<sub>Barriers</sub> to your success should be well understood. There is always a reason you haven't already completed your
 goal. When you explicitly acknowledge why, you can then form a plan to work around these barriers.

<h4>Pitfalls | Goalsetting Anti-patterns</h4><p>
Let's explore what can happen when one of these components is missing or improperly constructed.
<p>
If you don't know </em>what<em> you want to accomplish, you will waste time working hard on things which won't advance the
goal. If you don't know </em>how<em> to complete the goal, you probably won't make progress. Spending the time to learn how is
well worth it. If you don't really </em>want<em> to complete a difficult goal, you probably won't put in the effort. Desire is
necessary to get through the tough bits.

<h3>the benefits and pitfalls of goal setting</h3><p>
<h4>the benefits</h4><p>
<ul>
<li>if a person has the knowledge and skill, there is a linear relationship between goal difficulty and the person's
    performance.
</li>
<li>goals that are specific and difficult lead to a higher performance than a vague goal.
</li>
<li>feeling 'success' does not depend on absolute performance, but performance in relation to one's goals.
</li>
<li>when people perform well, they generalize the positive affect to the task, liking the task more than they did
    previously.
</li>
<li>goal setting can relieve boredom by imbuing tasks with a sense of purpose, leading to higher focus
</li>
<li>Potential rewards of praise, public recognition, and money have no effect on performance unless they lead to the
    setting of and commitment to a specific high goal.
</li>
<li>believing that you have taken on difficult goals leads to an increase in reported positive emotion, job satisfaction,
    and feelings of success in the workplace.
</li>
<li>the negative effects of a lack of personal goal achievement can be mitigated when goal progression is experienced at
    work.
</li>
<li>in summary, the benefits include
<ul>
<li>goals affect our choices and provide direction
</li>
<li>goals increase effort, persistence, and process efficiency
</li>
<li>a goal can provide meaning to an otherwise (personally) meaningless task
</li>
<li>goal attainment gives rise to a sense of personal accomplishment, which in turn increases our sense of personal
        effectiveness, a a basic psychological need.
<h4>the pitfalls</h4><p>
</li></ul><li>when people lack the knowledge and skill to attain a specific performance goal, performance falters. A performance
    goal may direct cognitive resources to sheer effort when it would be more appropriate to first gather more
     information, or learn new skills.
</li>
<li>performance goals can have a negative effect on a group's performance if there is a perceived conflict of interest
    among group members.
<ul>
<li>when goals are perceived to be competitively related, members are tempted to pursue their own goal single-mindedly
</li>
<li>when goals are perceived to be independent, members are likely to keep interaction to a minimum.
</li>
<li>only when goals are perceived to be cooperatively aligned does the group experience a boost in productivity.
</li>
<li>therefore it is vitally important that high-level goals are framed in a cooperative way.
</li></ul><li>goals that are framed as a threat (a punishment for failure, rather than a reward for success) are not effective.
</li>
<li>goals can have an adverse effect on risk-taking. 
<ul>
<li>this can lead to rigid and ineffective behavior
</li>
<li>It is important to frame failures as learning opportunities
</li>
<li>this allows failures to yield useful information, rather than being a waste of time.
</li>
<li>mistakes are inevitable in any non-trivial task. make the most of them through error management
</li>
<li>providing ample opportunity to make mistakes and make every effort to learn from them.
</li></ul><li>when failure is harshly punished, less difficult or vague goals are likely to become the norm.
<ul>
<li>it is better to view mistakes as transitory, and part of the learning process.
</li></ul><li>another barrier to goal setting is, paradoxically, goal attainment.
<ul>
<li>goal attainment leads to higher satisfaction and self-confidence which can frequently lead to a dysfunctional
        persistence of previously used strategies (rigid behaviour).
</li>
<li>there are two antidotes
</li>
<li>in dynamic situations, actively search for feedback and react to it. break down large goals and always be mindful
        of errors. Errors in previously successful tasks show where the mental model may not account for a changing
        situation.
</li>
<li>encourage constructive conflict. In groups, appoint 'nay sayers' and rotate the position frequently. The purpose is
        to combat group think, by always having someone question and look for flaws in the proposed solution. 
</li></ul><li>goals that are tied to large rewards can encourage people to fudge the numbers when they are close to attainment, but
    can't quite close the deal. One approach to mitigate this effect is to implement a continuous linear reward. Hitting
    the goal receives the whole reward, but getting close also merits part of the reward.
</li>
<li>the next pitfall occurs when a goal becomes idealized and tied up in identity. this can lead to irrational and risky
    action to obtain the goal regardless of possible cost and consequence. Identity is an exceptionally powerful
    motivator. When a goal gets intermixed with identity, failure can be seen as personally threatening and is responded 
    to with maladaptive, defensive behaviors.
</li>
<li>non-goal performance dimensions can be ignored. This is a function of the purpose of goals, which is to provide
    direction and focus efforts. By definition, less attention must be paid to other aspects. If a certain outcome or
    action is critical, a goal should be set for it.
</li>
<li>goals can be stressful. attempt to keep the number of goals reasonable. before committing to goals, make sure that
    there is a base level of relevant skill, resources, and self-confidence. Taking on too much at once is a recipe for 
    failure.

short cuts here. It is similar to the idea that being just 0.1% better every day will still lead to exponential growth 
if you keep at it (resulting in being twice as good over 2 years).

Motivation will arise when you know three things:

<li>the task motivator, or why the task is important
</li>
<li>how to complete the task
</li>
<li>that you can finish the task
</li></ul><p>
The 6 Types of motivators
There are 6 types of motivators, roughly ordered here by strength, which account for the vast majority of motivations
behind all human accomplishments:
<ol>
<li>survival (food, water, shelter, sex)
</li>
<li>identity (honor, integrity, in-group politics)
</li>
<li>compassion
</li>
<li>play
</li>
<li>internal motivators (for personal gain/satisfaction/curiosity)
</li>
<li>external motivators (to impress others, reputation)
</li></ol><p>
Deeply understanding the motivation behind each goal is essential to ensure that the goal will correctly address the
underlying desire.
<p>
Nothing kills motivation quite so quickly as feeling powerless to make change.
The point is not to become an expert before beginning, but to gain an rough idea and reduce doubt about the process.
<p>

<p>
<p>
Knowing the different types of motivation can also be used as a catalyst for generating motivation. Playful intention 
can be created by gamifying
the task. Internal motivators can be added by promising yourself a reward. Compassion based motivation can be generated 
by ensuring that your work
will help someone else. Imagine just one person whose life could be made better by what you're doing, and do it for 
them.
<p>
<h4>mental contrasting</h4><p>

<li>mental contrasting https://www.happierhuman.com/mental-contrasting/
<ul>
<li>may have limited empirical evidence
</li>
<li>smells like it is placebo based
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<h4>Technique Summary</h4><p>
If you find your motivation wavering, ask yourself these three questions:
<ol>
<li>Can you do it?
<ul>
<li>When asking yourself this, visualize not only the attainment of the goal, but also the struggles along the way.
</li></ul><li>Will it work?
<ul>
<li>Will completing this goal address the underlying issue?
</li></ul><li>Is it worth it?
<ul>
<li>After reflecting on the effort required and the benefit of pursuing your task, with the confidencethat you can do
     it if you make the effort, is the goal worth it?
</li></ul></li></ol><p>
will it work?
<ul>
<li>Do you know enough about the problem to make a reasonable guess at a process that will be effective and that will solve the underlying issue?
</li>
<li>if you don't perhaps focus on learning more, but don't be afraid of uncertainty. A reasonable guess is all that you need to proceed.
</li></ul><p>
Can you do it?
<ul>
<li>Visualize success and acknowledge obstacles as realistically as possible.
</li>
<li>acknowledge and address shortcomings in skill and knowledge if you can't yet.
</li></ul><p>
Is it worth it?
<ul>
<li>now, knowing the path forward, and that you are capable, is the cost worth the reward? weight the consequences
</li></ul><p>
By focusing on and answering these three questions, you can maintain motivation for even the most grueling tasks, when
 it's really important.
I recommend you commit them to memory. If you answer a hard no to any of the three, examine the reason why closely. This
 is a barrier that will keep you from success. 
It may be time to refine or even abandon the goal.

<h2>performing under pressure</h2><p>
Feeling social or time pressure to perform statistically has a hugely negative impact on performance, but there are ways to reframe these feelings.
Get excited:
</li>
<li>interpret nervous energy as excitement rather than panic, or trying to suppress the feeling
</li></ul><p>
Equate:
<ul>
<li>the effort needed to perform in a high stakes environment is exactly the same effort needed in a low stakes environment.
</li>
<li>equate the test to the practice exam, something you've handled already
</li></ul><p>
Control:
<ul>
<li>focus only on the aspects you can control. Its more important that you give a presentation well (something you control) than that the presentation is well received (something you don't).
</li></ul><p>
These three aspects lead to three sentences which can be said before a high performance event.
The high pressure mantra:
I am excited to perform.
In a way, it's just like how I prepared.
I'll just focus on what I can control.

<h2>Forming and Breaking Habits</h2><p>
While constant self-control is a herculean task, forming a habit is the easiest thing in the world. Leveraging habits is
 an effective way to enact long term changes.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
The Anatomy of a Habit
<ul>
<li>trigger
</li>
<li>expectation
</li>
<li>response 
</li>
<li>feedback
</li></ul><p>
Often we think of the response as a single unit of action, but really, if the habit takes more than about 2 minutes to 
complete, then only the initial action is the response. This can be leveraged. habits are usefaul because they reduce
the cognitive load associated iwth routine tasks and can be leveraged to make self-discipline easier. However, habit 
become maladaptive when they persist when the positive feedback is no longer a result of the response, or the habit has 
negative long term effects.
<p>
habits form naturally when
<ul>
<li>the trigger is noticable and regular
</li>
<li>the expectation is high
</li>
<li>the response is easy to do
</li>
<li>the feedback is intermittent/random, and matches the expectation
habits are naturally time sensitive.
</li></ul><p>
The way to form and break habits are opposite sides of a coin. Each technique focuses on changing characteristics of the
 trigger, response, or feedback in a way that makes the habit as a whole more or less addictive. Let's treat each of 
 these components in turn, first dissecting what makes them strong, then weak
<p>
<h4>strengthening triggers</h4><p>
<ul>
<li>stack habits together, use an established habit as the cue for a new one.
</li></ul><p>
<h4>weakening triggers</h4><p>
The next best way is to eliminate the trigger by changing the environment. This is harder because often the trigger is
 mental, or the environment cannot be strictly controlled.
<p>
<h4>strengthening expectation</h4><p>
the expectation is strong when it is massively positive or negative. Also when it is intermittent, this is why gambling
 is so addictive.
<ul>
<li>increase the expected value of a task by tying something enjoyable to the completion of a task
</li>
<li>also, make feedback slightly intermittent
</li></ul><p>
<h4>weakening expectation</h4><p>
the expectation is weak when the feedback is predictable and mostly neutral.
<ul>
<li>temper expectations by requiring an unpleasant activity to go along with the response you are trying to get rid of. 
  It is important that the unpleasantness comes </em>before<em> the old response, and as soon as possible after the cue, so the
  cue becomes associated strongly with a new expected value.
</li>
<li>do something else, besides the conditioned response, that you enjoy at least as much. The trigger will start to be 
associated with that instead.
</li></ul><p>
<h4>strengthening responses</h4><p>
a response is strong when it is easy.
<ul>
<li>instead of thinking of all the parts of the habit, only consider the first step as the 'habit'. Reading just one page
 of a book after work is a habit that's easy enough,
  and you'll probably end up reading more anyway.
</li>
<li>set up the environment to make it easy to get started.
</li></ul><p>
<h4>weakening responses</h4><p>
a response is hard when it takes a lot of time or energy to get started
<ul>
<li>when you feel the trigger, consider every step and inconvenience along the whole reponse
</li>
<li>craft the environment to make it hard to get started. Put the cookie jar in a hard to reach place.
</li></ul><p>
<h4>strengthening feedback</h4><p>
<ul>
<li>track your progress with a metric! keep that streak
</li></ul><p>
<h4>weakening feedback</h4><p>
kill the positive feedback loop. This can be done by devaluing the anticipated reward by constraining the environment to
eliminate the reward, or make it difficult to access, etc. This method still requires some effort, as habits have 
momentum, and often won't disappear even if positive feedback is limited or intermittent.

<h1>Memory</h1><p>
<h2>how do we pass on knowledge?</h2><p>
This is an attempt to create a syncretic mnemonic device combining a variety of historic and modern memory techniques
in order to produce a 'one-stop-shop' for memory training that balances complexity (and therefore time invested) with
suitability for the kinds of memory tasks I care about.
<p>
In contrast to popular historical techniques which are usually described very simply, or competition techniques, which
require large investment for a very specific application, this tries to take the middle path.
<p>
#
<ul>
<li>idea/concept - a thought independent of any thinker/mind (egregore)
</li>
<li>knowledge - a concept as understood by a mind
</li>
<li>understanding - knowledge as it is applied in a particular moment
<ul>
<li>tacit understanding - the mind has an intuition about a concept, but the underlying theory is not strong enough to reason about it symbolically
</li>
<li>objective understanding - the mind takes a concept as an object of thought and effectively manipulates it symbolically
</li>
<li>ingrained understanding - intuitions about the concept influence the thoughts at the conscious level, but it is abstracted and not manipulated directly (as an object of thought)
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
at a great enough depth, all knowledge is tacit, the important factor is if ingrained understanding goes deep enough to capture the complexity needed
to effectively work at the level of abstraction desired/required.
<p>
distributed understanding is a very shallow kind of objecting knowledge in which deeper understanding is known to be accessible, but is not directly known.
Knowing what to look for, or who to ask and when implies some understanding about the shape and use of the concept, but
accessing distributed understanding is slow, which hinders effective use (if deeper understanding is necessary).
<p>
abstract/objective dichotomy
unable to become objective - lacks depth of understanding
unable to become abstract - not ingrained through practice enough for intuition
objective thought allows symbolic manipulation
abstact thought allows faster intuition

<h2>Design - how the system works</h2><p>
<h2>Theory - how memory works</h2><p>
short-term memory and long-term consolidation
<p>
things are easier to remember if they are:
<ul>
<li>more concrete (as opposed to abstract)
</li>
<li>related to other things you know
</li>
<li>surprising/funny/alarming/sexy / disgusting / rage inducing
</li>
<li>personally important
</li></ul><p>
spaced repetition helps store things in long term memory. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a very powerful tool for this.
In other words cramming doesn't work very well, especially if you want to remember it after the test.
<p>
multimodal exposure
<ul>
<li>provides a richer experience
</li>
<li>transforming data from one modality to another forces close attention
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Source Techniques</h2><p>
Fundamental to all memory techniques is the encoding of abstract information in concrete symbolism.
<p>
The Memory Palace is a common metaphor which places objects (ideas made concrete) in a physical place with the appropriate structure.
<ul>
<li>ordered items are placed along a path
</li>
<li>unordered collections are placed in a room
  Once placed, mentally travelling through the space lets you 'see' the objects there as reminders.
  Many other techniques build upon this metaphor.
</li></ul><p>
The memory palace technique can be augmented with skipping indexes. Commonly every 5th element is associated. This
allows for faster traversal of the list. It generates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list">skip list</a>
<p>
Another fundamental technique is grouping or clustering, which composes multiple points of data into a single object.
This helps circumvent the issue of limited short-term memory.
<p>
History walks are an application of the memory palace where distance represents time.
<p>
Person-action-object is a competition system used to memorize numbers.
It works by first memorizing a list of 100 people along with their distinct actions and objects
which are numbered 00 through 99. In this way 6 digits (2 per person, action, or object) can be clustered into a single
scene.
<p>
Mandalas are used to organize topical knowledge around a theme. Typically, the central theme is placed centrally,
with related knowledge around it in a circle.
<p>
<h2>The system</h2><p>
The core is PAO, with special consideration towards the selection of people so that they may also provide anchors
for extended topics.
A PAO memory system that doubles as anchors for other memory systems
<ul>
<li>100 historical figures with actions and objects to remember long digits
<ul>
<li>selected to be spread out in time to remember historical dates
</li></ul><li>11 fictional characters (with actions and objects) to serve as single digits (or no digit)
</li></ul><p>
topics
Start collecting Memory Palaces
<ul>
<li>paths
</li>
<li>rooms (order locations in the room so it can be used as a list or a set)
</li>
<li>grid
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Mechanics - how the system is represented by the computer</h2><p>
I do not want to the mnemonic device to be reliant upon computers for either construction or training.
I think it important to keep the method workable by hand, even if a computer speeds things along.
To this end, the data is written by hand in a csv format that emphasizes readability and the script is deliberately
straightforward and readable.

<h3>memory book</h3><p>
A good memory is always useful.
<p>
The trained memory is an art of attention and association. All systems are tuned to promote original awareness of the
object. Also, tangible and meaningful things are easier to remember, so other techniques exist to convert the abstract
and random  into concrete ideas. Periodic recall will solidify the memory once made. In order to remember any new thing
it must be associated to something already known. Bonus points if it's done in some ridiculous, inspiring or profound 
way. This creates what's called a link. The whole rest of the art is practice, the willingness to apply it, and
acquiring the symbolic language necessary to concretize the abstract.
Place more value in memorizing things which change slowly, and that will be useful in uncertain circumstances.
<p>
meta:
<ul>
<li>the true art is original awareness
</li>
<li>learn the symbols
</li>
<li>practice makes perfect. apply it everywhere
</li></ul><p>
make it easy:
<ul>
<li>concretize
</li>
<li>link to what you know
</li>
<li>make it ridiculous, inspiring, profound, or startling
</li>
<li>set up a cadence of periodic recall
</li>
<li>value on things that won't change more highly
</li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>In order to remember an object, you first must be intensely aware of the the object
</li>
<li>Images and tangible things are much easier to remember than the abstract
</li>
<li>memory is formed by the association of the new to an established memory
</li>
<li>abstractions can be given tangible approximations in order to make them easier to remember
</li></ul><p>
the memory palace
If you've heard of any of these memory techniques, it's probably the memory palace.
The traditional practice of memory techniques is centered around the memory palace. It uses to mind's particular ability
to picture tangible objects in relation to each other to codify associations between thngs. Sequential data is codified
in a 'walk' of a place, which puts distinct places into an order. This has been used for centuries to prepare speeches.
<p>
example concretizers:
<ul>
<li>slant words - similar sounding, but concrete phrases
</li>
<li>key words - representing whole ideas, especially good for presentations
</li>
<li>start and stop - link the first item of the list to a cue in the environment where you will need to remember. link the last item to a stopping symbol, or back to the cue.
</li>
<li>names - slant the name and link it to a caricature of their face.
</li>
<li>out of place objects can serve as cues
</li>
<li>numbers
</li>
<li>peg words - use number words as an index to access a list of items out of order.
</li>
<li>mutilation - destroy or alter a linked item to mark it as complete, or in another way. Use multiple methods of desctruction for multiple markers.
    eg: water, fire, animals
</li>
<li>day of the week - talk about the time sigil 622502514624
</li>
<li>speed reading - there is a limit to your eye speed, but most slow downs come from regressions. Link, summarize and cross reference as you go to read once and know it.
    use page numbers as pegs for bonus points
</li>
<li>mem graphs - overlay tabular or map data with a grid of numbers and letters. the quadrant word is linked to the data.
</li></ul><p>
<h4>grouping ideas</h4><p>
Short term memory seems to be about 7 things, but those things can be information dense groupings
<p>
idea compactions
<ul>
<li>groupings (heirarchy)
</li>
<li>PAO

	<em> integrate with

		<em> pitman shorthand
</li>
<li>just the gist
</li>
<li>compact representations
</li>
<li>numbers as words

The gnosis is close understanding and clear observation
Reality will assert itself whether you are prepared for it or not. Wishful thinking will leave you blindsided.
Therefore try to be informed enough to spot the most obvious bullshit in the widest range of topics.
Learn deeply the topics you care about, and validate what you learn for yourself as much as possible.
Also, tolerate uncertainty. Thinking in black and white is a gross simplification of the world that is much more dangerous than people realize.
The world at large is an too vast for the human mind to fully comprehend every detail and professing certainty where 
there is none will only trick yourself into trusting your faulty model of the world instead of your actual experience of it.
<ul>
<li>be informed and validate for yourself
</li>
<li>tolerate uncertainty, (negative capability)
</li>
<li>grow the ideascape. make this a priority
</li></ul><p>
<p>
<h2>grand rite of skill learning</h2><p>
The grand rite is a meta-pattern that describes a way to tackle a problem. The applications (and therefore the forms)
of this ritual are nearly endless. I'll describe the pattern, then a few applications.
<ul>
<li>the ULP
</li></ul><p>
Stated in the purest form:
<ol>
<li>Learn just enough to self correct
    seek source material, mentors and other outside perspectives to jump start your mental model of the problem.
</li>
<li>Identify barriers
    note what might hinder practice and specific failures that might arise.
</li>
<li>make an effort to eliminate the barriers
    Any potential failure becomes a pain point to work through. Make use of mental contrasting
</li>
<li>break down the task into its smallest components
    identify single aspects of the task as they relate to a specific failure mode, rank by importance / frequency in 
    the high level skill
</li>
<li>Identify the desired outcome
    create a SMART goal. Take your metric and simply measure where you are for a while.
</li>
<li>Identify the process
    how do you move in the right direction considering where you are?
</li>
<li>Accelerate towards failure
    iterate. fail early and often. Figure out how to fail softly. Iterate on your process to speed up feedback loops
    and fail faster. Form new theories and learn to test quickly.
<ul>
<li>deliberate practice as a series of methodical micro-experiments (so good they can't ignore you)
</li></ul><li>Review and consolidate
    simplify the model. Generalize and recontextualize your findings. Go through a retrospective or recap, and review it
    periodically as needed.
</li></ol><p>
<h2>learning</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>pomodoro technique
</li>
<li>spaced repetition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)
</li>
<li>20 hr rule
<ul>
<li>imagine disaster - as a way to break down the most essential parts and get a clear picture of a target performance
        level
</li>
<li>know just enough - to get started, anything more is procrastination. Academic knowledge of a skill rarely is 
        sufficient, figure out the flow and feel, then start practicing to really get it.
<ul>
<li>monitor hypothesis 
<ul>
<li>learning is only valuable if it allows you to plan edit and correct yourself while practicing
</li></ul><li>practice raises more questions, and can lead to informed discussions with experts
</li></ul><li>struggle &amp; sleep - break practice into short sessions followed by a nap/sleep, within four hours of sleep.
        Intensity is important too.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
Effective practice
<ul>
<li>peak - anders ericsson &amp; robert pool on deliberate practice
<ul>
<li>deliberate practice generate effective mental representations
</li>
<li>these representations allow
<ul>
<li>recreating experiences
</li>
<li>making accurate predictions
</li>
<li>condensing information
</li></ul><li>four components of purposeful practice
<ul>
<li>have a specific goal
</li>
<li>practice sessions were intense
</li>
<li>received immediate feedback
</li>
<li>frequent discomfort, frequent mistakes
</li></ul><li>force a creative insight, or feel repeated discomfort
</li>
<li>with expert coaching, we can adopt effective mental representations to jump start the practice
</li>
<li>purposeful methods + expert coaching = deliberate practice
</li>
<li>deliberate practice by nature is uncomfortable because it is a process of stretching your limits
</li></ul><li>logical fallacies as barriers to learning
also, how to deal with false information? guarding against epistemic closure (in the sense of confirmation bias) in 
adaptive information systems. The quality of learning is highly dependant on the correctness of the input data.
</li>
<li>feynman technique often the best way to learn something is to teach it to others
<ul>
<li>also from feynman, keep a set of problems, and whenever you get something new, apply it all of those problems
        if something pans out you'll be seen as a genius.
<ul>
<li>problems and techniques (research and development) are opposite ends of the solution path. Applying A</em> dijkstra's reduces the search space.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>
a curriculum is set up to change behavior and supply a context for that behavioral change, not only to supply
information. thus curricular objectives should specify context and behavior, bound together by high level philosophy 
(since not everything can be covered, every exclusion is political), not necessarily specific information to be 
conveyed. basic principles of curriculum and instruction by ralph w tyler
<p>
the philosophical basis of learning should be self consistent, focused, partially derived from norms and balanced with 
necessities of reality and the interests of the student.
<p>
5 elements of effective thinking
<ul>
<li>earth: what are the core components?
    box the unknowns and get the structure
</li>
<li>air: perspective shifting questions &quot;what if I...?&quot;
    look at things like a beginner, a pro, or a customer
</li>
<li>fire: how can I make more mistakes?
    run experiments and check failure modes
</li>
<li>water: how can I build on whats working/iterate?
</li>
<li>wood: identify as a life long learner
    the only constant in your thinking should be change
</li></ul><p>
goal setting in a group context
In order to make progress towards a goal, you first have to know what the goal is.
In this section we cover the anatomy of a goal and a process for goal creation. Then, we describe one way that you could
 apply these methods in a process of continuous self improvement.

Another consideration is ensuring that the information here isn't lost through the ages. some encodings are effective
only in the short term. Stories that rely heavily on cultural touchstones will lose meaning across the world. Songs that
 use clever rhyme may lose their cleverness through shifts in accent and across languages. Memes usually die within the
 week.
</li></ol><p>
<h3>Chaos Magic</h3><p>
Symbolic ritual (psychodrama) that is focused on results rather than tradition.
Belief, symbolism and ritual become tools to be experimented with and used when useful rather than dogmatically
That is not to say that the tools are interchangable. The specifics of the spell have a major impact ofn its efficacy, but the necessary specifics vary on an individual basis.
Understand the pattern so you can improvise.

<li>the tricky part of seeing the beauty of mathematical proof is knowing enough to know which parts are mechanical thought
        and which are leaps of insight
</li>
<li>by automatically generating links between related ideas with no assistance from a human, a computer can suggest previously unknown associations

<li>treadmill problem - given that the human senses are all limited by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold">absolute threshold</a>
    some small force could be applied to the body which would be guaranteed to be unnoticeable.
    Additionally, there is a maximum force that the human body can exert.
    If we built an omni-directional treadmill (or equivalent harness for 3d), which accelerated below that threshold in
    order to dynamically keep it's user in the center, that would lay the framework for effectively infinite/boundaryless
    virtual spaces (since in all cases the 'corrective' force applied to the user would be undetectable).
<ul>
<li>Given that these limits exist, how large does the treadmill need to be?
</li>
<li>The max force limit depends on the max speed being finite and small, so simulated vehicles might be problematic, though
        relative force perception sensitivity decreases as absolute force increases, so perhaps this could be fudged.
</li>
<li>the treadmill will essentially need to run some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID</a> loop based on the users location.

    Does harmony have a visual analog in fractals, or do fractals with Hausdorff dimensions close to simple fractions
    appear more orderly or aesthetic? Is there a way to generate diverse fractals with a specific hausdorff dimension?
</li>
<li>can an EEG placed on the back of the neck do eye tracking based on detecting unconscious neck muscle twitches that correlate to eye movement?
    This could offer a way to do eye tracking 'in the field' where you don't have anything obstructing the field of view.
    If combined with a body cam, can you accurately locate the gaze on objects in the environment?

<p>
<ul>
<li>areas of (possibly ad hoc) computer research/development that most things fall into.
<ul>
<li>algorithmic - applied math. How can computers do things correctly and efficiently?
</li>
<li>ergonomic - how can the language/tools/etc we use be more expressive/powerful/high-level/transparent/learnable
        and help us avoid pitfalls.
<ul>
<li>whereas algorithms can be as esoteric and complicated as they need to be, the tools we use cannot be because we are only human.
            It must be possible to package performance code into a library with a relatively simple interface so that
            most people won't have to interact with that complexity most of the time.
</li>
<li>all (most) of the effort being put into new languages (or the constant rotation of new javascript frameworks) belongs here.
</li></ul><li>hardware - applied physics. how do we put lightning in a bottle?
</li>
<li>legal - licensing, right to privacy, right to repair, ethical hacking,
</li>
<li>social - how do you manage a project? How do you manage project lifetimes, or attract maintainers? codes of conduct?
        diversity and inclusion?
</li>
<li>domain understanding - understanding a clients needs well enough to represent domain specific knowledge in a program.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>crafting heritage
<ul>
<li>manufacturing (the production of goods, including software) lies on a spectrum between totally manual and totally automated.
<ul>
<li>by manual I mean a single person (or small group) can create some functional version of the product with locally 
      available and unrefined materials
</li></ul><li>in all industries the extreme manual end can be done with very minimal tooling
</li>
<li>in some industries, the automated end can become self-recursive / self-reliant 
<ul>
<li>using steel cauldrons to smelt steel
</li>
<li>using compiled compilers to compile compilers
</li></ul><li>for a self-reliant goods, a failure to recurse necessitates a sudden shift toward the manual end.
</li>
<li>In our current economy there is an extreme emphasis on automated production, because it scales better and is therefore more profitable.
</li>
<li>In the case of hobbyists, most only have the resources to experiment with very manual production.
</li>
<li>The middle ground is neglected. Lets call it 'semi-auto' or early industrial
</li>
<li><em>cue tinfoil hat</em>
</li>
<li>this creates a potential for failure where a good is very self-reliant but unable to recurse for a short period.
</li>
<li>in response its industry is unable to sustain itself at current levels, and cannot effectively scale back to
    early industrial levels because that 'middle knowledge' isn't actively kept by anyone.
</li>
<li>If the failure is bad enough or the good sufficiently dependent on high quality recursion, it takes more than
    a generation to recover enough semi-auto capacity to start rebuilding fully automated capacities. 
</li>
<li>at this point, not only has a generation been lost to re-industrialization, but the high end production knowledge
    has also degraded. Hopefully those running fully automated plants had the forethought to write down what they knew
    as the plants had to shut down. Hopefully that knowledge wasn't kept as an 'industry secret' for a company that
    could not possibly survive a full generation of reduced capacity.
</li>
<li><em>proceeds to solve a problem that probably doesn't exist</em>
</li>
<li>support the working class of production by seizing... this isn't a shit post I swear.
</li>
<li>create an industry conservatory that works to refine 'clean room' toolchains and regularly rebuilds tools from
    the ground up as a way to ensure that there's always someone around who has done it.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>there are a few classes of problems in computer science and engineering that get solved repeatedly in adhoc ways.
<ul>
<li>The huge prevalence of copypasta code is a testament to the failure to capture complexity in a library.
</li>
<li>can we use stats on copied code from StackOverflow as a way to design libraries/languages and better cover common complexity?
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>there's a very important class of computation that translates one set of symbols into another, sometimes called compiling or compilation.
<ul>
<li>we can think of compiling abstractly as a translation (reversible or lossy) of a structured set of symbols into another.
</li>
<li>The elements of the input don't necessarily need to be from the same set as elements in the output, nor does their structure (list, tree, etc) need to be the same.
</li>
<li>my point is that there is a structural similarity between json-munging and compilers, between Terraform and LLVM.
<ul>
<li>Perhaps this structure could be exploited to propagate optimizations up and down the tech stack (manually).
            What can compiler developers learn from web developers, and vice versa?
</li>
<li>Perhaps also this could be used to define a 'core' compute engine that self-optimizes (self-compiles?) based on properties
            of the input and output  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">languages</a>, but is capable of running
            in a number of environments (bare metal, posix, JVM, etc.)
</li>
<li>could we describe the various instruction sets and the translations between them in a unified, rigorous way?
            all the way through logic gates -&gt; x86 -&gt; system calls -&gt; JVM -&gt; javascript. Could a monolithic 'compiler'
            understand how to optimize in each of these contexts?
</li></ul><li>example applications:
<ul>
<li>compiling typescript to javascript
</li>
<li>compiling javascript to bye code
</li>
<li>generating configuration on the fly (aka turing complete wrappers for inept 'no code' tools)
</li>
<li>translating between human languages
</li>
<li>parsing a string into json
</li>
<li>data normalization in general
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>the study of magic and magical thinking is useful because people turn towards alternative solutions when
<ul>
<li>they can't or haven't been able to formulate the issue they're facing distinctly enough to address it directly
</li>
<li>there isn't an accepted/comprehensible/workable solution to the problems they face
</li>
<li>the magic works in some sense, though not necessarily through the proposed mechanisms.
        Most likely for psychological or social issues.

</li></ul><li>the point of metaphysics isn't truth but ease of reasoning about physics
<ul>
<li>this is why occam's razor is so powerful
</li>
<li>given two models that 'effectively' give the same predictions, using the one that requires less computation
        allows us to predict more. and is therefore more pragmatic
</li>
<li>it isn't just about getting the right answer, but also doing so in time, with our limited brains
</li>
<li>once we move beyond the edge of where we can effectively find a 'correct' answer (which isn't very far)
        we need to consider answers which instead have desirable consequences
        (desirable here being subjective, and subject to manipulation)
</li>
<li>occam's razor then gives us a tool by which we can reason about belief.
</li>
<li>complex metaphysics are less performant and so would naturally be selected against (memetics) unless they had a hidden benefit.

For a given subject, what is the appropriate detail with which we should memorize it?
What topics and perspectives should we allow to form our identity?
For what topics is it enough to simply know the names of concepts, so they can be reached with google?
