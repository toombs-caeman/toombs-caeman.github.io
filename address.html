<h1>@</h1><p>
I'm designing a system for naming locations in the home where things are stored,
like a filing system for papers, but in 3d space.
<p>
It should be:
<ul>
<li>easy to create in an adhoc way, like how you would direct someone to it by speaking
</li>
<li>effective to navigate to an object
</li>
<li>unambiguous even when spoken
</li>
<li>succinct to write
</li></ul><p>
status: not used, not tested
<h1>heirarchy</h1><p>
Give rooms unique names like <code>master</code> or <code>B</code> for the master bedroom.
levels of a heirarchy are separated with <code>.</code>, starting with the largest division.
<p>
<h1>names</h1><p>
give name such that the structure abbreviations will be obvious. Generally each room will have a name.
<ul>
<li><code>m</code> master bedroom
</li>
<li><code>mb</code> master bathroom
</li>
<li><code>gb</code> guest bath
</li>
<li><code>k</code> kitchen
</li>
<li><code>i</code> kitchen island - this isn't a room, but it gets a name to differentiate <code>k+</code> and <code>i+</code>
</li>
<li><code>w</code> workshop
</li>
<li><code>o</code> office
</li>
<li><code>cc</code> coat closet
</li>
<li><code>lc</code> linen closet
</li></ul><p>
<h1>axis</h1><p>
cupboards are counted left to right.
shelves are counted from the floor up.
you can extend this to 2d if you have a grid of shelves, but you have to decide which is the major and minor axis.
<code>3.4</code> would refer to the third major and 4 minor division.
<p>
relative directions (left, right) are given to in relation to your orientation entering the room, or when looking at a shelf.
floors are counted normally.
<p>
<h1>generic abbreviations</h1><p>
use <code>.</code> as a separator if needed
structures
<ul>
<li><code>_</code> floor
</li>
<li><code>/</code> wall
</li>
<li><code>-</code> shelf
</li>
<li><code>c</code> closet
</li>
<li><code>+</code> cupboard (shelf with a door)
</li>
<li><code>n</code> table
</li>
<li><code>x</code> box
</li></ul><p>
counts - before what they describe
<ul>
<li><code>2-</code> second shelf (shelfs are implicitly counted from the bottom)
</li>
<li><code>2v</code> second from the top or second from the back
</li></ul><p>
directions - after what they describe (these are arrows)
<ul>
<li><code>^</code> highest | count from the bottom | backmost | count from the front
</li>
<li><code>v</code> lowest | count from the top | frontmost | count from the back
</li>
<li><code><lt;</code> leftmost | count to the right
</li>
<li><code>>gt;</code> right most | count from the left
</li>
<li><code>*</code> middle
<h1>examples</h1><p>
counts are given before the thing being counted (as you would when speaking)
</li>
<li><code>2v-v</code> second shelf down (count from the top) in the front
</li>
<li><code>2<lt;+^</code> second cupboard from the right in the back (2nd, count from right, cupboard, back)
</li>
<li><code>m<lt;c_<lt;</code> (master bedroom, leftmost, closet, floor, leftmost) = on the floor of the leftmost master bedroom closet, to the left
</li>
<li><code>o.c_3x</code> (office, closet, floor, 3rd from left, box) = in the third box from the left on the floor of the office closet
