<h1>Style vs Concept</h1><p>
presentation vs content.
What is the impact of aesthetics on <a href="knowledge#transfer">:conveyance of information</a>?
<p>
fluency - ease of data ingest correlates with apparent 'truthfulness'
aphorisms, truisms, witticisms are sticky pith because they are memorable (highly fluent) even though they are obviously cached thoughts of dubious value.
<p>
<h1>metaphor</h1><p>
good metaphors are predictive, the parts hang together in a way similar to the signified, so symbolic manipulation yields results that also apply to the signified.
good metaphors also have lower cognitive load than direct manipulation.
Math in its abstract form (as writing) is a metaphorical (symbolic) system for numbers (which are themselves abstractions of fungibles) in which manipulations are explicitly defined (while 'metaphor' is usually used when the system allows implicit operations).

<h1>concrete vs abstract style</h1><p>
<a href="computerthoughts">Tradeoff</a> between immediate practicality and generality
presenting things in very concrete terms is good for introductions, but it isn't always clear how the ideas <a href="abstraction">generalize</a>.
After the initial introductory example, present the principles as an abstraction of just one or two layers.
There is a sweet spot where being too abstract makes it difficult for a learner to apply concepts concretely, but being too concrete hides the fact that the ideas being discussed also apply generally.
<p>
<h1>contrasting styles clarify principles</h1><p>
seeing the same ideas implemented in different contexts can make it more clear which aspects are specific to context and which generalize.

<h1>Esoteric encodings, or useful delusions</h1><p>
&gt;&gt; One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star -- Nietzsche
<p>
Now that we have the why, let's lay out the mental models what will serve as a starting point or framework through which
we can discuss the techniques used to cultivate the qualities discussed above.
<p>
<ul>
<li>old stories are the only thing left of ancient civilization because they are a durable/adaptable form
</li>
<li>religion is told in stories
</li>
<li>physics is taught in stages to teach the process and uncertainty as well as the facts (avoiding dogma)
</li></ul><p>
The utility of some beliefs far outweigh the probability of their objective, literal truth. Even more interesting are
the beliefs which hold their utility even when they're held ironically, or while lacking a genuine faith. This ironic
distance has the additional benefit of allowing your beliefs to be fluid, changing easily in support of your
experience without endangering ideals with which you identify closely. The ability to hold a belief strongly, yet drop
it as soon as it is no longer useful provides maximum utility.
<p>
Classical physics is a fairly clear example of this. Even though it is well known that these equations and simplistic
views of gravity are in fact incorrect, they are still widely useful for being only mostly correct. Pareto's law: a
model 20% correct will provide a passable answer 80% of the time. Thus a simple model, well built, has more utility than
an accurate model so complex as to be impractical for casual use.
<p>
What follows is a description of the mind that makes only a passing attempt at accuracy in order to provide a workable
model for self-improvement. I provide sources if you wish to dive deeper into the 'real' truth, but I hope the model
will be at least a good starting point to introduce a framework for thinking about the mind. Truly believing in this
modal will have an enormous effect on how you choose to live in and reaction to the world around you. But the map is not
the territory, so believing ironically will allow most of the benefit, without the dangers of dogma. Take the parts that
are useful and ditch the rest.

mental states
The discussion of mental states often tends to become a discussion of emotion, and 'how to manage your anger/anxiety/
boredom/etc.'. It would of course be difficult to be effective at much of anything when ruled by emotion, but by taking
your own emotion as the context and looking at your relation to them, in terms of these energies, you may be able to
understand and change how your emotions affect you.

<h2>esoteric encodings</h2><p>
<ul>

<li>esoteric encodings
</li>
<li>disconnect between map and territory (ideas and the language used to express them in context)
This book tries as much as possible to provide mental techniques as discrete and repeatable instructions with supporting
science based references to document their efficacy. However, this is only one way to present the information. Other
encodings, or ways of presenting information, may be more effective depending on the situation. Scientific explanation
tends to be dry, heavy handed, and long winded. While I believe it is necessary in order to establish this book as more
than voodoo, it won't appeal to everyone. Other ways of presenting this information are necessary which will connect
with people wherever they're at, by translating these ideas into the symbolic language familiar to them.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
There is some precedent for this. Every old religion has mandates embedded in their stories about how to live, and what
not to do.  These stories are effective in their teaching because they are easy to remember, and can convey their
message directly, without supplying lengthy evidence, in part because of their religious tone. By contrast, modern
science is presented as a set of facts and figures. This puts science at a disadvantage. Pop science takes only the
convenient sound bytes from an ever rotating list of 'current' topics.
<p>
Yet others have attempted to teach things through interactive experiments, interpretive dance and song. The format
itself is somewhat irrelevant, as long as the message is transmitted faithfully.
<p>
Possible encodings include:
<ul>
<li>song
</li>
<li>dance
</li>
<li>murals
</li>
<li>mind palaces
</li>
<li>poems
</li>
<li>sculpture
</li>
<li>video
</li>
<li>memes
</li>
<li>abstract jazz

<li>magical ritual
</li>
<li>and whatever else.
</li>
<li>speeches

<li>writing

<li>fictional narrative stories/fables/parables
</li>
<li>non-fiction history
</li>
<li>encyclopedia
</li>
<li>how-to
</li>
<li>essay
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
Different formats of course appeal to different audiences, and are appropriate in different contexts.
<p>

<h2>shibboleths</h2><p>

<h4>Placebo Triggers</h4><p>
<ul>
<li>self induction of the placebo effect
Another topic for further research is the placebo effect in relation to the regulation of certain chemicals in the body.
While this effect is usually small and difficult to control, I believe it is possible to use effectively, especially in
the context of religious or 'folk' knowledge which is passed down generationally. This can give a certain advantage to
information transfered this way, which is made very difficult to effect on current science, because of its method of 
transmission.
</li></ul><p>
Similarly, priming effects, like the one used by tarot and other divination, can be used more easily with some 
encodings, and are worth considering as a way to add a subtle flexibility and robustness to the contained information.
