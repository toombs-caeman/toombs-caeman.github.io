The theory of memory is a central component to the theory of mind.
Memory as I will talk of it here is specifically the explicit stage in depth of learning


* depth of learning

## explicit constructs
* number systems
* mandela
* journey
* functional - axiomatic compression of a wide set of conclusions
    (eg the central equations of physics are remembered rather than their infinite consequences. 
        Rules of mechanical reasoning captures complex behavior in finite mindshare
    )

## external memory
* Phone
* Notebook
* Site
