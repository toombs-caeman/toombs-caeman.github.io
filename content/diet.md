The problem with dieting in general is that we talk about them as if food is the problem.
It's rarely a problem of the right nutrients being unavailable or even a lack of knowledge about what constitutes a healthy meal.

The true problem lies in the difficulty of changing a habit that doesn't even appear to most people to be a habit.
Your body is a reflection of how you use it. Short-term changes in behavior can only have short-term effects.
