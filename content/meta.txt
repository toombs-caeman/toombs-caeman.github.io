Well if you want to enjoy the experience then maybe. But if you'd rather watch on forlornly as sections of your site break
for no apparent reason and spend hours upon hours debugging regular expressions when you could be watching grass grow then have I got just the thing for you.

Introducing [blog.sh](https://github.com/toombs-caeman/toombs-caeman.github.io/blob/master/blog.sh)
, a static site generator that's pure bs (bourne shell)

This site is served using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is entirely static.
There's no server side processing and no client side javascript (not even for the burger animation). Pages are rendered as part of the git pre-commit hook.

If I ever have to move away from github for some reason, the site could be hosted as simply as nginx or httpd serving an up-to-date copy of the repository.
Nginx logs can be captured to [provide the same analytics](https://serverfault.com/questions/447370/how-to-count-unique-visitors-in-an-nginx-access-log)
available on github, namely unique visitors per week. I use python for the development server, but that's just me being lazy.
