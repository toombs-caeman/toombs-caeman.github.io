This site is served using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is entirely static.
There's no server side processing and no client side javascript (for now). Pages are rendered as part of the git pre-commit hook.
You can view the [project repo](https://github.com/toombs-caeman/toombs-caeman.github.io) here.

If I ever have to move away from github for some reason, the site could be hosted as simply as nginx or httpd serving an up-to-date copy of the repository.
Nginx logs can be captured to [provide the same analytics](https://serverfault.com/questions/447370/how-to-count-unique-visitors-in-an-nginx-access-log)
available on github, namely unique visitors per week. I use flask as the development server, but that's just me being lazy.
