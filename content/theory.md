People behave according to theories they hold about how the world works, regardless of if they have explicitly stated it,
or are explicitly aware that they hold that theory.

A few key theories people might not think about:
* theory of mind
* theory of group dynamics (politics)
* theory of history

by making these models explicit, we can reason about them in rational ways in addition to
the more typical heuristic reasoning. It also induces the Learning Effect of Language.
