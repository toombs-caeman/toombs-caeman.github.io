This method for improving writing was described in Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography

dissect and reconstruct
-----------------------

1. Take a short piece of writing, whose style you respect, and break it down to bullet points of the main ideas.
2. Set both aside for a few days at least
3. From your notes only, try to re-express the piece as completely as the original
4. Compare your recreation with the original, correcting any faults
    * note any points missed in your summary
    * note awkwardness in phrasing, or dullness of vocabulary in the recreation

For more complete mastery:

* jumble the bullet points and compare and recreate the structure of the essay as well
* do not keep notes, but keep the summary in memory only
* instead, record your recreation as a speech to force a single chance at recreation
* convert the prose to verse instead of bullets to train vocabulary and strength of metaphor and rhythm
