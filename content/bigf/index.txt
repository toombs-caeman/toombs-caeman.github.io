`layout=default`

This method for improving writing was described in Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography

## dissect and reconstruct

<ol>
* Take a short piece of writing, whose style you respect, and break it down to bullet points of the main ideas.
* Set both aside for a few days at least
* From your notes only, try to re-express the piece as completely as the original
* Compare your recreation with the original, correcting any faults
<ul>
    * note any points missed in your summary
    * note awkwardness in phrasing, or dullness of vocabulary in the recreation
</ul>
</ol>

For more complete mastery:

<ul>
* jumble the bullet points and compare and recreate the structure of the essay as well
* do not keep notes, but keep the summary in memory only
* instead, record your recreation as a speech to force a single chance at recreation
* convert the prose to verse instead of bullets to train vocabulary and strength of metaphor and rhythm
</ul>

## Finished Reconstructions

<ul>
`for page in $pages; do [[ "$page" == "bigf/"* ]] && li_date_page; done`
</ul>


## Unfinished

<ul>
`for page in $pages; do \
  if [[ "$page" == "bigf/"* && "$page" != "bigf/index.txt" ]]; then \
    echo -n "<li>"; page_link; \
  fi; \
done`
</ul>
