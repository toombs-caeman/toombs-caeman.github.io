Here I attempt to answer the question 'why take notes, and why like this?'.
If you want to know how the code implements this see the Site page.

## Why take notes
The Theory of Notes is a partial Theory of Mind.
By understanding how memory works we can derive how to take good notes and vice versa.
By surveying popular and powerful note-taking devices we can derive anecdotal evidence for how memory functions.
This idea hails back to the classic [memex](https://www.w3.org/History/1945/vbush/) of Vannevar Bush.

## Qualities of bad note-taking systems
* hard to enter information
    * too much friction is the biggest reason I don't write something down.
* hard to find information
    * a 'Info black hole' where thoughts go to die
* not persistent, or owned by someone else.
    * In either case it is likely to disappear unexpectedly.

## Qualities of good note-taking systems
the extra complexity and friction of mechanical aids has to be justified by extra capability.

* a human **should not** have to date things sort, search, cross-link, or index things by hand.
    Computers can and should do this.
* the indexes that the computer generates should be stable as the notes grow, and should reflect the natural associations 
    formed by a human. The structure of notes is itself a useful piece of information that the human can learn, 
    and at greater depth of learning than the data itself. As such it shouldn't change as fast as the data it indexes.
    Computers can regenerate an index much faster than a human can re-learn it.
    * Some people argue that [time is an essential component of organizing notes](https://thesephist.com/posts/inc/)
    * Others argue that 'position on the page' is essential for recall of information. Both of these are true to an extent.
    
* The computer should generate unexpected insights through mechanical reasoning
    * by automatically generating links between related ideas with no assistance from a human, a computer can suggest previously unknown associations
* ease of sharing
    * social learning
* object permanence


## good systems I've seen

* Paper is hard to beat and is the golden standard for data entry.
    * on the other hand, the paper can't assist you very much with indexing, dating, cross-linking, etc.
        These things can be done by hand of course, but its not very efficient.
    * it's difficult to share or rather it can't easily make use of the internet.
    
* [](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)
    * I love the 'association first' rather than 'index first' discovery
    * the dudes content is fairly interesting too.
    * unfortunately not available for use
