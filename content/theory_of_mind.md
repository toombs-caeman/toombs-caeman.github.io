## computer metaphor
memory is much better thought of as the whole memory cache system (disk -> RAM -> L1 -> L0 -> registers) than just RAM.
working memory is like registers, very size limited and likely to be overwritten
long-term memory is RAM.
physical notes and such are disk.
distributed understanding is like the network.
