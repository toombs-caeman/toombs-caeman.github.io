# python programming
## getting started by level
* for non-programmers
    * [resource guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
    * [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) (free online book)

* for programmers
    * [basics syntax and usage](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
    * [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
    * [standard types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
        * most important: int, float, str, list, set, dict, range, iter
    * [overview of standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
        * most important: re, time, datetime, enum, math, random, itertools, functools, os, sys, logging, typing, unittest, pdb, venv, dataclasses
    * other important libraries
        * requests, beautifulsoup - working over HTTP
        * numpy, pandas - number crunching
        * matplotlib - data plotting
        * django - web framework
        * tk, wx - GUI development

* advanced python stuff
    * [data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)

## quickest start
1. check to see if python is already installed.
    * in the terminal, the python interpreter is accessed with the command `python`. You can exit the interpreter with Ctrl-D.
    * If not available, install through your system package manager or by [downloading](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * The package is probably called `python`
2. create a file `hello.py` which contains the line `print("Hello World!")`
3. run the command `python hello.py`
    * should see output `Hello World!`
