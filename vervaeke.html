incomplete notes on
<h1>Awakening from the meaning crises</h1><p>
<p>
need to pull out definition of
<ul>
<li>relevance realization / combinatorial explosion
the courage to be - tillich
</li></ul><p>
science offers a powerful way to know the world, but it doesn't offer a way for us to know our place in it.
The agent-arena relationship is essential in order to construct meaning, and a meaningful life.
<p>
gestalt-feature axis
transparency-opacity axis
there are three mystical experiences:
<ul>
<li>pure consciousness - at the extreme of opacity and features, when consciously aware of consciousness directly.
</li>
<li>at oneness - extreme of transparency and gestalt, when experiencing profound concordance/resonance of everything
</li>
<li>both extremes at once - 
</li></ul><p>
<h1>14 epicureans</h1><p>
talks about the formation of the stoics
<h1>15 marcus aurelius and jesus</h1><p>
how do we accept that we are finite beings
loves:
<ul>
<li>eros - care through consumation, sex or cookies
</li>
<li>philia - care through communion, reciprocity, love of friends
</li>
<li>agape - care that creates a person from a non-person.
agape is why christianity took over the roman empire, by promising personhood to the disenfranchised.
</li></ul><p>
<h1>19 augustine and aquinas</h1><p>
plotinus - neoplatonist founder
<p>
the science of desire for meaning says we need three things:
<ul>
<li>coherence - the more 'real' (realized) things are, the more they fit together (to oneness). nomological order
</li>
<li>significance - how valueable and deep your life is. normative order
</li>
<li>purpose - does your life have a direction. narrative order
</li></ul><p>
augustine says I have this
<ul>
<li>things make sense according to the aristotilian order (nomological)
</li>
<li>significance comes through anagoge. reason + agape
</li>
<li>the messianic story of jesus provides the narrative.
</li></ul><p>
meaning is to have a nomological order that connects us to what is real.
It is to have a normative order that connects us existentially to what is good so that we can become better.
meaning is to have narrative order tells us how to move forward through historical and personal history.
These are not three separate things.
<p>
simultaneously a scientific spiritual, theraputic, and existential thing.
can we combination of scientific legitimacy, spiritual viability, and a personal project of theraputic change?
why did such a sophisticated frame fall apart?
<p>
after the collapse, the change in psychotechnology is that people start reading silently.
There is a loss of the communal aspect of reading, and 'reciting' a text becomes a less rich experience.
It is a difference between reading a poem and hearing it, or reciting it.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina">lectio divina</a>
<p>
shift towards aristotle, meaning a more emphasis on definition and proposition. 
coherence within a language (logic) rather than transformative qualities.
a new model of thought as having coherent propositions rather than con-forming to the object of thought.
the self exists as it is self-coherent, rather than externally connected.
<p>
aquinas
challenges the real-illusory world dichotomy by saying that it is possible to have real knowledge of the 'illusory' world through science
but the 'real' world is still more real. creates the distinction/terminology for natural vs supernatural world.
the supernatural defies reason and must be studied through faith.
This begins the fundamental separation between faith/love and reason that kicks off romanticism.
the separation starts an imbalance in 'realness' as science becomes more powerful.
as the supernatural world becomes no longer viable to us, then the whole axial worldview falls apart.
<h1>20 death of the universe</h1><p>
<p>
aquinas influences:
<ul>
<li>meister eckhart - representing the rhineland mystics (germany)
</li>
<li>william of ockham (of occams razor)
</li></ul><p>
where aquinas separates the nomological order by creating two separate (incompatible) worlds
the rhineland mystics create a new understanding of the normative order, from neoplatonic anagoge to theurgic descend of god (love) into the natural world (the will)
the will moves by love instead of will moving love.
agape is a self-sacrificing turn of the will.
spirituality is the self negation of the will that creates a space for agopic love.
inner conflict is valorized.
<p>
ascent through reason is cut off, since reason has no place in the higher world.
<p>
the bookness of a book isn't in the book, but is created by our calling it a book.
god speaks the world into existence by asserting its existence.
the world is absurd, and reason is through language only.
<p>
then the black death comes. this is seen as the coming the horsemen of the apocalypse.
there is a war against the cathars. and the church creates the secret police to root out heretics.
so many people died there is a shortage of labour and wages become a thing. people suddenly have mobility (physical social and economic)
<p>
mechantilism emerges as a way to gain wealth in a way independent from aristocracy and the church.
insurance, corporations, the secular state and contract law come into being to support this.
The supernatural world is largely irrelevant to these projects.
<p>
this also requires the adoption of a new psychotechnology, arabic numerals (replacing the roman numerals).
the availablility of zero and negative numbers.
increased trade changes ways of navigation at sea by the stars.
<p>
if mathematics describes the world in a more real way, and is sometimes unintuitive, then the aristotlean view of 'realness' is insufficient.
the con-formity of senses to the world is then not the best way to realize the world.
suddenly math is the singular way to relate to the world.
and math is divorced from geometry aka its visual analogy. geometry is now an abstract analogy of relations.
<p>
rather than purpose or 'spirit' now we have inertia. Galileo kills the universe.
inertia comes from the root 'inert'
<p>
the scientific method then is to use the way the inert world resists our will to reveal to us how we are deceiving ourselves.
<p>
<p>
<h1>23 romanticism</h1><p>
the romantics invert
<h1>24 hegel</h1><p>
proposes moving beyond kant/romanticism by rejecting the 'thing in itself'.
reality is just the patterns of intelligability - idealism
geist is the systemic development of ideals through time in a very impersonal way.
the main critics say that hegel is out of touch with the participatory knowing, having such an impersonal view of the machinery of history.
dialectic - a series of differentiation and integration that deepens understanding.
<p>
eventually the dialectic leads to a self reflective set of ideas. 'absolute geist'
<p>
marx says that the dialectic plays out not in religious arenas, but in class struggles
<h1>25 the clash</h1><p>
nationalism rises as the idea that the nation-identity can take the role that god has taken as the arena for a clash of ideals
emerging nationalism and empirialism become pseudo-religious ideologies to replace the eroding christian framework.
<p>
in germany this forward momentum comes to a grinding halt with the defeat in the first world war.
the undercurrent of gnosticism and the rhineland mystics cause huge anti-semetic problems
scientific materialism sees huge success.
ongoing protestant fragmentation.
a racist interpretation of history arises to replace hegel's idealistic or marx's socioeconomic interpretation
nazism is a gnostic nightmare that hangs between a religion a totalitatian ideology and personal mythology.
it is not just a political movement.
a tidalwave of bullshit.
<p>
marxism and nazism (which are diametrically opposed) clash at the eastern front.
<h1>26 cognitive science</h1><p>
equivocation - falling into confusion because you do not keep track of the meaning of your terms.
elegance - an 'elegant' theory is one that is plausible (produced by a convergence of multiple lines of evidence) and multi-apt (applies to many arenas)
without plausible convergence it is a conspiracy theory
without multi-apt-ness it is trivial
<p>
<h1>33 spirituality of rr: wonder/awe/mystery</h1><p>
<p>
in a spiritual sense, a pre-egoic binding that grounds the self in the world
<ul>
<li>religio - to bind together
<ul>
<li>complexification ->gt; self-trancendence
</li>
<li>self-deception
</li>
<li>connectedness
</li>
<li>perspectival knowing + participatory knowing =>gt; procedural knowing
</li>
<li>caring/significance
</li>
<li>altered states of consciousness - higher states of consciousness

<h1>36 reverse engineering enlightenment</h1><p>
<h1>37 reverse engineering enlightenment pt 2</h1><p>
perennial problems / potential solutions
<ul>
<li>parasitic processing / counteractive dynamic system
</li>
<li>modal confusion / sati
</li>
<li>reflectiveness gap / flow
</li>
<li>absurdity / prajana
</li>
<li>anxiety / inner dialogue with the sage
</li>
<li>alienation / communitas
</li>
<li>existential entrapment / gnosis
</li></ul><p>
<h1>38 agape and 4e cog sci</h1><p>
enlightenment == a set of psychotech within a wisdom framework that provides reliable responses to the perennial problems
the ecology of practices must be supported/encompassed by a viable worldview
<p>
loss of the three orders
<ul>
<li>nomological - coherence/connectedness
</li>
<li>normative order - significance, depth
</li>
<li>narrative order - purpose and direction
this loss exacerbates the perential problems
</li></ul><p>
4 E of cognitive science
<ul>
<li>embodied - the mind arrises as it comes into contact with the world
<h1>43 wisdom and virtue</h1><p>
solomon effect (paradox), illeism
ability on wisdom tests is enhanced by having dialog with someone else, even imagined.
it is easier to solve other people's problems than your own.
</li></ul><p>
<h1>44 theories of wisdom</h1><p>
<h1>45 nature of wisdom</h1><p>
sophrosyne - when negative things are no longer tempting, they become unthinkable (as a viable option) in contrast to self-restraint.
<p>
<h1>47 heidegger</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>the shining - relevance
</li>
<li>the withdrawl - combinatorial explosion
</li></ul><p>
<h1>48 corbin and the divine double</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>imaginary - as in the usual sense
</li>
<li>imaginal - as in a transjective symbol
beautiful wording (poetry) can generate appreciation while masking understanding. Needs recitation to ingrain it.
</li></ul><p>
divine double === angel === buddha nature === aspirational self
