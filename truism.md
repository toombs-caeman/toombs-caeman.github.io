# Truisms

## Pareto 80-20
Usually phrased as '80% of the benefit comes from 20% of the effort'.
Across many different fields, [roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

## Litany of Gendlin
    What is true is already so.
    Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
    Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
    And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
    Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
    People can stand what is true,
    for they are already enduring it.
    -- [:Eugene Gendlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin)

## Practice vs Theory
The difference between practice and theory is greater in practice than in theory.

## Clarke's three laws
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic -- [:Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke)

## Know Thyself
[Know Thyself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself),
not as in thy autobiography, but as in thy operators's manual
