# VR

## The Treadmill Problem
given that there is an absolute threshold of force perception, there is some small acceleration
which could be applied to a person's body such that they will never be able to perceive it.

Humans have some maximum acceleration their bodies can safely experience and, a much lower max acceleration
that they can generate with their own bodies over a sustained period.

Given this, and proper audio/visual/tactile feedback, it is possible for a human to be 
placed on a finite omni-directional treadmill which the human would never be able to escape,
nor would they be able to perceive that they are not moving in an unrestricted space.

This means that 'perfect' VR is possible in a finite space.
