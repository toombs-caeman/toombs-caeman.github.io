<p>People behave according to theories they hold about how the world works, regardless of if they have explicitly stated it,
or are explicitly aware that they hold that theory.</p>
<p>A few key theories people might not think about:
* theory of mind
* theory of group dynamics (politics)
* theory of history</p>
<p>by making these models explicit, we can reason about them in rational ways in addition to
the more typical heuristic reasoning. It also induces the Learning Effect of Language.</p></div>
