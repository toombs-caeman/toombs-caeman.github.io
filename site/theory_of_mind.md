<h2>computer metaphor</h2>
<p>memory is much better thought of as the whole memory cache system (disk -&gt; RAM -&gt; L1 -&gt; L0 -&gt; registers) than just RAM.
working memory is like registers, very size limited and likely to be overwritten
long-term memory is RAM.
physical notes and such are disk.
distributed understanding is like the network.</p></div>
