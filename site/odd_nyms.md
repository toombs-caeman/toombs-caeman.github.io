<p>english words are a bit like legos, building meaning up from reusable components.
On the other hand, it's not like that at all and never follws its own rules.</p>
<p>For a moment, lets appreciate those words whose pieces are so firmly stuck together the pieces are almost fused.</p>
<h1>(dis)gruntled</h1>
<h1>(im)mediately</h1>
<h1>(un)ravel</h1>
<p>which oddly enough, ravel and unravel are synonyms</p></div>
