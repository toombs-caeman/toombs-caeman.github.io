        <p>school was damaging because it taught you to get good grades (hack the test)</p>
<ul>
<li>striking if someone cares more about what is learned than the grade</li>
<li>learning <em>for the test</em> is common. Why study harder before the test?</li>
<li>learning is conflated with grades</li>
<li>author realized later when running YC</li>
<li>map != territory</li>
<li>with the test upcoming, time is not best spent reading the best books or learning.
    better to focus on trivia that seems like a test question</li>
<li>ignore deep concepts in favor of 'sharply defined' soundbites</li>
<li>also sometimes old tests are available</li>
<li>the mismatch between learning/good grades behavior forces a choice between the two</li>
<li>malthusian trap, everyone must 'play the game' or they won't get the grades</li>
</ul>
<p>so why are tests so hackable?</p>
<ul>
<li>artificially imposed tests (by authority) are hackable by default, since map != territory</li>
<li>it takes effort to counteract this (by authority) which usually doesn't happen</li>
<li>the artificiality of high school and the size of the test-prep industry are proportional to the hackability of entrance exams</li>
<li>the measure of entrance exams is also wrong (taste rather than intelligence)</li>
<li>high schoolers feel alienated b/c (as a result) their life is so artificial</li>
</ul>
<p>story ab advising startup founders at YC</p>
<ul>
<li>young founders overcomplicate</li>
<li>'hack to raise money?' -&gt; 'just make it a good investment' was met with confusion</li>
<li>'what makes a good investement?' -&gt; 'growth, ideally in revenue, otherwise users'
    immediately sprung to growth hacking, when 'make a good product' is better</li>
<li>astonishment at simplicity, rejection</li>
<li>
<p>they had never faced a non-artificial test, and thought that's how the world worked. money must be the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the aversion to big companies is rooted in the culture of winning by hacking bad tests.</p>
</li>
<li>naming the elephant as an antidote</li>
<li>points to education reform, how an established company can 'become more like a startup'</li>
<li>interviewee question 'to what extent do you win this kind of work by hacking bad tests?'</li>
</ul>
<p>first approximation of bad tests
* tests by authority are bad first, only unhackable through great effort
* misapplying/ over generalizing results</p>
<p>you may like hacking bad tests, but most people dislike the work</p>
<p>there's an assumption that 'lots of money' -&gt; 'bad tests in industry', but while that was true, now it's not.
* used to be two paths, executive or engineer
* hacking becomes less important as the link between work and authority erodes (flattening heirarchy)</p>
