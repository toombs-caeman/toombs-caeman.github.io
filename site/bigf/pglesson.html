school was damaging because it taught you to get good grades (hack the test)
<p>
<ul><li>striking if someone cares more about what is learned than the grade
<li>learning *for the test* is common. Why study harder before the test?
<li>learning is conflated with grades
<li>author realized later when running YC
<li>map != territory
<li>with the test upcoming, time is not best spent reading the best books or learning.
    better to focus on trivia that seems like a test question
<li>ignore deep concepts in favor of 'sharply defined' soundbites
<li>also sometimes old tests are available
<li>the mismatch between learning/good grades behavior forces a choice between the two
<li>malthusian trap, everyone must 'play the game' or they won't get the grades
</ul><p>
so why are tests so hackable?
<p>
<ul><li>artificially imposed tests (by authority) are hackable by default, since map != territory
<li>it takes effort to counteract this (by authority) which usually doesn't happen
<li>the artificiality of high school and the size of the test-prep industry are proportional to the hackability of entrance exams
<li>the measure of entrance exams is also wrong (taste rather than intelligence)
<li>high schoolers feel alienated b/c (as a result) their life is so artificial
</ul><p>
story ab advising startup founders at YC
<p>
<ul><li>young founders overcomplicate
<li>'hack to raise money?' -> 'just make it a good investment' was met with confusion
<li>'what makes a good investement?' -> 'growth, ideally in revenue, otherwise users'
    immediately sprung to growth hacking, when 'make a good product' is better
<li>astonishment at simplicity, rejection
<li>they had never faced a non-artificial test, and thought that's how the world worked. money must be the test.
</ul><p>
<ul><li>the aversion to big companies is rooted in the culture of winning by hacking bad tests.
<li>naming the elephant as an antidote
<li>points to education reform, how an established company can 'become more like a startup'
<li>interviewee question 'to what extent do you win this kind of work by hacking bad tests?'
</ul><p>
first approximation of bad tests
<ul><li>tests by authority are bad first, only unhackable through great effort
<li>misapplying/ over generalizing results
</ul><p>
you may like hacking bad tests, but most people dislike the work
<p>
there's an assumption that 'lots of money' -> 'bad tests in industry', but while that was true, now it's not.
<ul><li>used to be two paths, executive or engineer
<li>hacking becomes less important as the link between work and authority erodes (flattening heirarchy)
</ul><p>
