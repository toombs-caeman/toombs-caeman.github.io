<p>In these notes I talk about a specific subset of what is generally called 'magic'.</p>
<h2>what are we talking about</h2>
<p>My interest is in practical knowledge which may be dismissed because of its occult, cultural, or religious presentation.
* spellcraft as it is practiced, separate from the metaphysics
* focus on historical systems rather than fantasy
* less rigorous standard of evidence than a hard science or even a soft one. (more squishy)
Spellcraft here defined as any practice or system of practice in which some of the following are true:
* most practitioners do not understand how the practice is supposed to work (may be lots of handwaving)
* practitioners do not need to understand the system to effectively use it
* there are several competing (mutually exclusive) theories for why certain practices are supposed to work.
* the system is either not rigorously studied, or study is complicated by difficulty of replication in a lab setting.
* the underlying mechanism which enables the practice is very far removed from what is actually done in practice,
    either by accident, on purpose, or by necessity.</p>
<h2>what we aren't talking about</h2>
<ul>
<li>high fantasy</li>
<li>ESP</li>
<li>fireballs / levitation / the force</li>
<li>aliens</li>
<li>gods</li>
</ul>
<h2>why call that magic</h2>
<p>Since we're generally talking about things that don't have specific words already, my options are to make something up, or
to more tightly define existing vocabulary.
I wanted to avoid a set of vocabulary that already refers to a set of 'real' things.</p>
