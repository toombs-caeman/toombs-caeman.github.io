I've been obsessing lately over the idea that there's no good reason why there is more than a single implementation of sort present on a single computer.
Why is it that we need sort implemented in C, python, javascript, etc. each with a (potentially) different and arbitrary choice of algorithm?
<p>
Can a single language be simple enough at its core to compile it by hand (a la. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMG_(language">Ken Thompson's great story</a>))
but that can meta-program itself well enough to be viable on all levels of the stack?
<p>
I'm imagining a hyper-monolith that is compiler, operating system, scripting language, browser, and javascript all in one.
It would run on desktops, tablets, super-computers, smartphones, and micro-controllers. It's meta-algorithms would select
the appropriate way to sort given what it knows about its resource constraints, and the data it is sorting.
<p>
The data it collects on what is sorted, how often and how much, would be compiled. It would know its own strengths and weaknesses.
This data can be used tune the meta-algorithm. Perhaps that tuning would inform the next generation of chip design.
The monolith can compile real world performance analytics into verilog, to produce a chip that will perform faster.
<p>
The monolith generates its own documentation from its own source with the right flag.
<p>
I believe all the pieces exist, in one form or another. The only question is if they all fit together in a useful shape.

<h1> It's not just sort</h1>
the same ideas recur, with varying levels of sophistication, in widely different contexts.
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication">IPC</a> is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">networking</a>.
<p>
ISAs are DSLs
<p>
everything turing complete is equivalent.
<p>
The browser is a desktop environment with better ergonomics for how it installs programs (websites are turing complete after all)
<p>
Caching happens in the processor (from memory), in memory (from the disk), in the disk (from the network) and in the CDN (from the site).
If a program can be programmatically re-installed or updated when needed, how is that different than a cached web resource?
Even a compiled binary could be considered a cache of the source (again if it could be dynamically recompiled when needed).
<p>
compilation and compression are intimately linked.
<p>
<p>
<h1> novel(ish) language ideas</h1>
<p>
<ul><li>context free functions (pure, or only manipulating memory already exclusively allocated to that process) have only
    a single meta-algorithm, which is available throughout the whole stack.<li>top-level applications mark which functions a human user will be waiting on (real-time, human-facing IO) versus functions
    on which performance is not hyper noticeable.
<ul><li>this allows meta-algorithms to experiment with various implementations of sort in various contexts.<li>real performance statistics are used to find the optimal algorithm to apply in the human-facing scenario<li>this optimization / recompilation happens in the background</ul></ul>

<h2> language design</h2>
<p>
<ul><li><a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> has probably done the most on "langauge-oriented" programming, or meta-programming
    as an explicit strength of a language.<li>Lisp is the OG as far as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a> and self-modifying programs</ul>
