I was pretty nervous, and I made a lot of mistakes being unfamiliar with the mechanics.
The story was pretty highly scripted, and light on the worldbuilding and roleplay aspects.
You could say it was pretty rough, but I had fun and I think the players did too.
There was a second session.
<p>
<ul>
<li>I started with an escape sequence, so that the session starts with a very clear objective, and a limited path forward. When they got out, I let them set a destination to let them have some choice, but ended the session there (so I could prep the next area). I see this as like the first escape mission in Skyrim. It's a linear tutorial before an open world adventure.
</li>
<li>I made sure that the first encounter was could easily be scaled in difficulty on the fly, since I wasn't sure of how much the party could handle.
