# Productivity
The point of being productive is to efficiently [:realize](#realize) what you value.
[:If you have things you care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXBA4eWskrc), you should care about productivity.

[:Stylistically](style) though, the genre of 'productivity hacks' is very much focused on the specifics of an implementation, devoid of the principles and the 'why' question. It often manages to be both too vauge to apply directly, and too specific to apply to me.

And while tips and tricks are great, they only let you go faster. It's pretty pointless if you're going in the wrong direction so figuring out what you value is more important.

Luckily the self-accountability that 'productivity' systems often create can be useful in figuring out your values, based on how you are acting currently. And if you don't like what you see, you've got the perfect hammer with which to change things.

# :x realize
Meaning both to 'make real' and 'to comprehend'

## why aren't you already optimally productive
There are any number of reasons plans fall through. Even when a project is [:personally important](#grandma).

'Productivity Proper' typically focus on preventing a few failure cases:
* lack of, or fading motivation `6.27` `7.25`
* procrastination
* decision fatigue
* time/priority management
* forgetting tasks
* unreasonable or misaligned goals

* study hacks

## Aesthetic clusters
A few sources of 'productivity' for [:contrast](style#contrast)

### Productivity Proper
The style is pretty exclusively aimed towards either personal improvement, or professional improvement (usually for executive/management types).

* books aimed at executives (4 hour work week, traction, GTD)


### factory efficiency
There's another genre stemming from the ideas of [:W. E. Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming) speaks about techniques for factories and assembly lines. These ideas took a trip around the world [:through japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System)
and then returned a few decades later in [:american software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)).
While the focus and tone of the writing are slightly different, many of the same ideas pop up.

### Benjamin Franklin
The writing of [:Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin)
also contains a bit of study advice between a lot of [:bawdiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_to_a_Friend_on_Choosing_a_Mistress)

# types of systems
While sharing an underlying goal, there are different ways of describing
* goal setting (how to know what to do)
    * [polarization](ifs#polarization)
    * 'yes is nothing without how' (never split the difference)
        * in IFS, getting motivated about a goal doesn't mean real emotional buyin without a realistic idea of the journey there
* action management (how to get it done)
    * motivation/emotion focused. procrastination and alignment
    * task tracking
* stuff management (how to have what you need to do it)
    * knowledge management
    * 'organizing' or thing management, differing from knowledge management mostly by the fact that it's physica
    * workplace organization (physical context)
    * calendars (timely context)
* avoiding specific failures and antidotes
    * procrastination (tim pychyl `6.49`)
    * perfectionism - moving the goalpost to avoid starting, or the fear of achievement
    * distraction (pomodoro, deep work)
    * continuous improvement (kaizen, seinfeld calendar)
    * accountability
    * vascillation/multitasking
    * ok plateaus (moonwalking with einstein)
* generating ideas, brainstorming, creativity
* making things repeatable
    * habit formation (and addiction breaking)
    * toyota production system
    * process control `7.64`

## system parts
* master commitment document
* capture tools
    * zeigarnik effect
* execution contexts
    * context specific reminders
* timely reminders
    * calendars
    * periodic review (weekly?)
        * what worked? what didn't?
        * what lessons did I learn?
        * how did my habits go/where did my time go?
* feng shui/workplace design
* building an index around reference materials
* planning actions
* runbooks, standard operating procedures (SOP), spells
    * [:checklists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto)

## Physical or Digital
There is a struggle with keeping every-thing in one place when some 'things' are digital and others physical.
It's ultimately personal whether the 'source of truth' is digital or physical.

## incremental adoption, overhead, lock-in, specificity
* does the system require a radical restructuring all at once, or can it be adopted slowly, or in part?
* how flexible is the system? can it adapt to all ways of life, professions?
* once started with a tool, how difficult is it to migrate data to a new system?
* what is the cost/time overhead of buying/maintaining the system?


## Productivity adjacent Systems
* capture all incoming information
    * organize such that it biases towards action?

The book is definitely written for someone in a managerial or executive role, but there is no reason why the principles can't be adapted for anyone.

# customization mandatory
it seems like the 'systems as written' don't really work for many people. No system would work for everyone.

A knowledge management system.
* fleeting notes [:capture](#capture) ideas. They should be re-written in a few days to clarify meaning
* take notes in your own words
    * write notes as you read, watch, think in the shower, etc.
    * simply linking or copying information is insufficient to actually learn
* establish connections between new notes and your topics of interest (which should also be captured as notes).
    * connections
* establish keyword-categories. This is not a place to store a note, but a context in which you would like to retrieve it.
    * in which curcumstances do I want to stumble upon this note. When would it be useful?
    * keywords are established in relation to recurring topics rather than the note in isolation
* notes should be atomic
    * or be sequences of atomic notes (a train of though), but only when the sequence itself is important to generating information.
* notes should have an identity
    * this is used to reference/link notes to related stuff.

# :x Deep Work
[Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work) by [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/)

[:video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTaJhjQHcf8)

'Deep Work' is defined as professional actions taken in an a distraction-free environment that push your cognitive abilities o the limit. This is the source of new value. This is in contrast to 'Shallow Work', such as filling out paperwork, shuffling emails, etc.

1. use [:ritual](ritual) to quickly transition into (and out of) focused work
    * actively create a distinct psychological space for focus
    * Try to get blocks quality focus rather than trying to work longer hours
    * transition out of focus by [:capturing](#capture) work that you're in the middle of. DO NOT CONTINUE WORKING after you've captured your final thoughts.
2. use [:attention training](attention) to enable higher quality focus
    * embrace boredom
    * take breaks from focus rather than breaks from distraction. mindfulness should be the default. schedule distraction and structure serendipity
    * one can severly limit and structure the time alloted to a goal. work at the cognitive limit train intensity
    * avoid thought loops/rumination.
3. [:drain the shallows](values)
    * invesitgate and drop low value behaviors
    * do social media, entertainment, infotainment actually contribute to your goals? Do they actually help you unwind?
    * In every moment keep in mind the value proposition of what you're doing. What goal are you working towards?
    * be difficult to reach in order to cut down on low value interactions. Set expectations early, cut off back and forth communication/low stakes negotiation. Don't respond.


# :x craftman's tools
adopt a tool only if it's positive impact on your success and happiness substantially outweighs the negative.
Simplicity is a virtue.

# :x aesthetic
why is it that 'productivity gurus' seem to have converged on an aesthetic?
is the intersection of 'people who care about productivity' and 'filmmaker/writer' that small?
Does the intersection imply a certain aesthetic, or is it a group identifier?

Systems are typically presented in the [concrete style](style#concrete).

# :x SMART goals
Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound

# :x grandma
A few years ago my grandma was seriously ill and thought she was going to die in the hospital.
At the time the most important thing she wanted to do if she recovered was to write her memoirs.

Then she recovered and started working, but her motivation flagged here and there. Writing a book is hard.
Three years later it was finished and a small number were printed for family. My mom's a hero for helping her through that.

My point is not that she used some crazy productivity hack™, but that without help and the accountability it's probable she never would have finished.
Even though it was **literally her dying wish** (so she thought).
