# Productivity
The purpose of 'productivity' is to [enable](#agency) one to [accomplish](#follow) [what one sets out to do](#goals) [with minimal fuss](#impediments).



There are any number of reasons plans fall through.
Productivity systems typically focus on preventing particular failure cases that stem from ???
* lack of or fading motivation `6.27` `7.25`
* time/priority management
* forgetting tasks
* unreasonable or misaligned goals

## philosophy
"time is not money when you know you're going to die"
-- [:Brad Aeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXBA4eWskrc)

# types of systems
    * goal setting (how to know what to do)
        * [polarization](ifs#polarization)
        * 'yes is nothing without how' (never split the difference)
            * in IFS, getting motivated about a goal doesn't mean real emotional buyin without a realistic idea of the journey there
    * action management (how to get it done)
        * motivation/emotion focused. procrastination and alignment
        * task tracking
    * stuff management (how to have what you need to do it)
        * knowledge management
        * 'organizing' or thing management, differing from knowledge management mostly by the fact that it's physica
    * avoiding specific failures and antidotes
        * procrastination (tim pychl `6.49`)
        * perfectionism - moving the goalpost to avoid starting, or the fear of achievement
        * distraction (pomodoro, deep work)
        * continuous improvement (kaizen, seinfeld calendar)
        * accountability
        * vascillation/multitasking
        * ok plateaus (moonwalking with einstein)
    * generating ideas, brainstorming
    * making things repeatable
        * habit formation (and addiction breaking)
        * toyota production system
        * process control `7.64`

## system parts
* master commitment document
* capture tools
    * zeigarnik effect
* execution contexts
    * context specific reminders
* timely reminders
    * calendars
    * periodic review (weekly?)
* feng shui/workplace design
* building an index around reference materials
* planning actions
* runbooks, standard operating procedures (SOP)
    * [:checklists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto)

## Physical or Digital
There is a struggle with keeping every-thing in one place when some 'things' are digital and others physical.
It's ultimately personal whether the 'source of truth' is digital or physical.

## incremental adoption, overhead, lock-in, specificity
* does the system require a radical restructuring all at once, or can it be adopted slowly, or in part?
* how flexible is the system? can it adapt to all ways of life, professions?
* once started with a tool, how difficult is it to migrate data to a new system?
* what is the cost/time overhead of buying/maintaining the system?


## Productivity adjacent Systems
* capture all incoming information
    * organize such that it biases towards action?
* [building a second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)
* process control, deming, `7.64`
* [minimalism](https://www.theminimalists.com/pitch/) as intentionality in adding complexity (to one's live)

A knowledge management system.
* fleeting notes [:capture](#capture) ideas. They should be re-written in a few days to clarify meaning
* take notes in your own words
    * write notes as you read, watch, think in the shower, etc.
    * simply linking or copying information is insufficient to actually learn
* establish connections between new notes and your topics of interest (which should also be captured as notes).
    * connections
* establish keyword-categories. This is not a place to store a note, but a context in which you would like to retrieve it.
    * in which curcumstances do I want to stumble upon this note. When would it be useful?
    * keywords are established in relation to recurring topics rather than the note in isolation
* notes should be atomic
    * or be sequences of atomic notes (a train of though), but only when the sequence itself is important to generating information.
* notes should have an identity
    * this is used to reference/link notes to related stuff.

# :x Deep Work
[Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work) by [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/)

'Deep Work' is defined as professional actions taken in an a distraction-free environment that push your cognitive abilities o the limit. This is the source of new value. This is in contrast to 'Shallow Work', such as filling out paperwork, shuffling emails, etc.

1. use [:ritual](ritual) to quickly transition into (and out of) focused work
    * actively create a distinct psychological space for focus
    * Try to get blocks quality focus rather than trying to work longer hours
    * transition out of focus by [:capturing](#capture) work that you're in the middle of. DO NOT CONTINUE WORKING after you've captured your final thoughts.
2. use [:attention training](attention) to enable higher quality focus
    * embrace boredom
    * take breaks from focus rather than breaks from distraction. mindfulness should be the default. schedule distraction and structure serendipity
    * one can severly limit and structure the time alloted to a goal. work at the cognitive limit train intensity
    * avoid thought loops/rumination.
3. [:drain the shallows](values)
    * invesitgate and drop low value behaviors
    * do social media, entertainment, infotainment actually contribute to your goals? Do they actually help you unwind?
    * In every moment keep in mind the value proposition of what you're doing. What goal are you working towards?
    * be difficult to reach in order to cut down on low value interactions. Set expectations early, cut off back and forth communication/low stakes negotiation. Don't respond.


# :x craftman's tools
adopt a tool only if it's positive impact on your success and happiness substantially outweighs the negative.
Simplicity is a virtue.

# :x aesthetic
why is it that 'productivity gurus' seem to have converged on an aesthetic?
is the intersection of 'people who care about productivity' and 'filmmaker/writer' that small?
Does the intersection imply a certain aesthetic, or is it a group identifier?

Systems are typically presented in the [concrete style](style#concrete).
