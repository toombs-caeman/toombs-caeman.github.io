* knowledge is power. we care about knowledge because it corresponds to reality, and knowing gives us power
    * what happens when knowing more doesn't give us more agency?
        * triviality
        * alexander pope, mimir's well
        * knowledge of [congitive biases](https://www.readthesequences.com/)
* knowledge transfer problem
    * learning
    * teaching
        - education is politics

# pedagogy / self-directed learning
what is an effective way to go about learning a new field?
If there's an established tradition of learning, probably follow that (a la Peak by Ericsson)
but if there isn't???
* feynman technique
* effective pedagogy
create an open pedagogy or meta-teaching methods to better educate people on effective education of all methods
this would need to be developed alongside an open content engine to empower people wishing to contribute to domain
knowledge need to deduplicate ideas in order to consolidate the space, sort of like wikipedia but truly decentralized to
skirt censorship need to get away from monetization so that people aren't incentivized to make crap like on youtube
* n-back task
* first principles
* bloom's 2 sigma problem, mastery learning
* Douglas Brooks, Japanese wooden boatbuilding https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PorYEpLKEYk
    a very different take on pedagogy than I've seen. The student is not taught so much as expected to observe
