# Dune

I love [:Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune) as a novel.

The superhuman abilities shown in the novel are described in a way that seems all too possible, if training was deliberate and complete enough. Not that this would be necessarily healthy, but what *is* the limit of human performance?

# Mentats
[:Mentats](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Mentat) are an order trained as 'human computers' which become necessary for the ruling class as 'thinking machines' are outlawed. They are trained to suppress all emotions and to devote themselves to logical rigour.

    Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.
â€” Frank Herbert, Dune
