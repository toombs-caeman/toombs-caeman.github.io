# Notebook System

I've kept [:physical notebooks](pens.md) for over a decade now, I've used various analog task-tracking/planner systems and for the past five years or so I've been working on a project I call the **primer**. I'll spare you the [:origin story](#story) and just focus on the method I use now.

Every notebook gets the same setup:
* With the front of the notebook up, write along fore-edge in black.
    * The name of the book goes on the left and its number goes on the right.
    * The name is usually the year in which it's started and the role it plays.
    * The number just goes in sequence.
* Title page - the first page (on the right side) gets my name, contact info, and the name of the notebook. This is page zero.
* Even number pages are numbered in the top right corner (zero is even).
* Index spread - the first two page spread is for the Index.
    * Pages are referenced like `title:20`. Title *then* page number, so theres' room add more pages later.
* Page titles are centered.

I usually have a few notebooks active at any given time. The division isn't so much topical as it is related to the context in which I would want to look back at something I've written.
Right now I've got:
* a journal/planner
* one for extended notes (usually for the primer)
* one for D&D stuff

Everything of importance is written into the notebooks. This ensures no writing can get lost without it being very obvious and also ensures that everything can be referenced in a uniform way.

# :x story
I started out using the **Bullet Journal** method but found it didn't suit me.
* calendar bound tasks are better tracked on an electronic calendar which can send notifications (push rather than poll)
* some of the journaling and writing I do is worth revisiting but most of my day to day tasks are not. Keeping the two interspersed diluted both efforts. I keep two separate notebooks now.
* migration, which is central to the method, seemed wasteful and tedious.

While I still use something like the bullet journal method of marking tasks, the higher level process is much more in the style of **Getting Things Done**.

I've also taken some inspiration from the principles of **Zettelkasten**, but the idea of using loose index cards doesn't appeal to me (except for **recipes**).

## References
References are written shorthand that [^links] things together.
I try to keep the topic of each page **atomic** so that references point to a [:single idea](#single).

here are some examples:
* `71` or `(71)` - page 71 in the current notebook (current as in the notebook containing the reference).
* `7.71` - page 71 in notebook 7
* `(dune 106)` - page 106 of the book *Dune*. (at least of my copy, and if I care to reference it I probably have one)
* `YYYY-MM-DD` - date format

# :x single ideas
This is tricky when some 'single ideas' are actually a connection between other ideas, some sort of narrative, or an argument that connects ideas in sequence. If an idea is worth refering to in isolation it gets its own page (and a backlink from the sequence).

[^links]:
In the messy world of ideas, I've found that organizing things is a struggle.

The idea of tagging generally implies a duality between the task of generating content and categorizing it. One side or the other inevitably gets neglected, and ultimately it's a false duality anyway, since metadata is just data. What happens if you have thoughts on the category as a whole? Is there a privileged index which is somehow special? Pretty soon you'll have [:ten thousand kinds of data](tao#42).

Categories are like tags but worse, since they also enforce an unwarrented heirarchy. Also, because namespaces within two categories are separate, you must always copy the whole path to disambiguate references

I haven't gotten completely away from these problems with this reference system, but it's simple enough to keep using. References are unintrusive as possible. 'Categories' or 'Collections' and even the 'Index' are just pages that are referenced like any other.


## Closing Thoughts
This is the core of the system, just a uniform way to number things so they can be referenced, yet I've found it incredibly valuable to look back through my thoughts on occassion. Its simplicity and flexibility are the real strengths.

In the future I'll polish up a few sections of notes to add to the site.

# :x TODO
* describe planner
* describe primer
* describe D&D notes
[Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/)
I see value in being able to look back in time with some accuracy but I believe 'review-value' density is more important than exhaustiveness. There's enough info overload in my life.

I prefer the [Sapphire A5 dot-grid Rhodiarama Soft Cover (~$18)](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_premium_rhodiarama_soft.php)  notebook
with a black [Pilot Metropolitan (~$19)](http://pilotpen.us/brands/mr-metropolitan/mr-metropolitan-fountain/?product=1164) fountain pen
and Noodler's [Heart of Darkness (~$19)](https://noodlersink.com/product/19808-heart-of-darkness-4-5-oz/) ink.
* I consider the journal to be a 'permanent' record. The todo lists are deliberately transient. If I'm planning a larger project or something important happens it usually goes in the journal, but the day to day mechanics of doing it don't. I leave space by the index for a 'structured index' to be completed when the book is full. It groups pages by topic rather than the order in which I happened to write them.
