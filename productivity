<h1>Productivity</h1>
The purpose of 'productivity' is to <a href="#agency">enable</a> one to <a href="#follow">accomplish</a> <a href="#goals">what one sets out to do</a> <a href="#impediments">with minimal fuss</a>.
<p>
<p>
<p>
There are any number of reasons plans fall through.
Productivity systems typically focus on preventing particular failure cases that stem from ???
<ul>
<li>lack of or fading motivation <code>6.27</code> <code>7.25</code>
</li>
<li>time/priority management
</li>
<li>forgetting tasks
</li>
<li>unreasonable or misaligned goals
</li></ul><p>

<li><a href="ifs#polarization">polarization</a>
</li>
<li>'yes is nothing without how' (never split the difference)

<h2>Physical or Digital</h2>
There is a struggle with keeping every-thing in one place when some 'things' are digital and others physical.
It's ultimately personal whether the 'source of truth' is digital or physical.
<p>
<h2>incremental adoption, overhead, lock-in, specificity</h2>
<ul>
<li>does the system require a radical restructuring all at once, or can it be adopted slowly, or in part?
</li>
<li>how flexible is the system? can it adapt to all ways of life, professions?
</li>
<li>once started with a tool, how difficult is it to migrate data to a new system?
</li>
<li>what is the cost/time overhead of buying/maintaining the system?
</li></ul><p>
<p>
<h2>Productivity adjacent Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li>capture all incoming information
<ul>
<li>organize such that it biases towards action?

A knowledge management system.
<ul>
<li>fleeting notes <a href="#capture">:capture</a> ideas. They should be re-written in a few days to clarify meaning
</li>
<li>take notes in your own words
<ul>
<li>write notes as you read, watch, think in the shower, etc.
</li>
<li>simply linking or copying information is insufficient to actually learn
</li></ul>establish connections between new notes and your topics of interest (which should also be captured as notes).
<ul>
<li>connections
</li></ul>establish keyword-categories. This is not a place to store a note, but a context in which you would like to retrieve it.
<ul>
<li>in which curcumstances do I want to stumble upon this note. When would it be useful?
</li>
<li>keywords are established in relation to recurring topics rather than the note in isolation
</li></ul>notes should be atomic
<ul>
<li>or be sequences of atomic notes (a train of though), but only when the sequence itself is important to generating information.
</li></ul>notes should have an identity
<ul>
<li>this is used to reference/link notes to related stuff.

'Deep Work' is defined as professional actions taken in an a distraction-free environment that push your cognitive abilities o the limit. This is the source of new value. This is in contrast to 'Shallow Work', such as filling out paperwork, shuffling emails, etc.
<p>
<ol>
<li>use <a href="ritual">:ritual</a> to quickly transition into (and out of) focused work
<ul>
<li>actively create a distinct psychological space for focus
</li>
<li>Try to get blocks quality focus rather than trying to work longer hours
</li>
<li>transition out of focus by <a href="#capture">:capturing</a> work that you're in the middle of. DO NOT CONTINUE WORKING after you've captured your final thoughts.
</li></ul>use <a href="attention">:attention training</a> to enable higher quality focus
<ul>
<li>embrace boredom
</li>
<li>take breaks from focus rather than breaks from distraction. mindfulness should be the default. schedule distraction and structure serendipity
</li>
<li>one can severly limit and structure the time alloted to a goal. work at the cognitive limit train intensity
</li>
<li>avoid thought loops/rumination.
</li></ul><a href="values">:drain the shallows</a>
<ul>
<li>invesitgate and drop low value behaviors
</li>
<li>do social media, entertainment, infotainment actually contribute to your goals? Do they actually help you unwind?
</li>
<li>In every moment keep in mind the value proposition of what you're doing. What goal are you working towards?
</li>
<li>be difficult to reach in order to cut down on low value interactions. Set expectations early, cut off back and forth communication/low stakes negotiation. Don't respond.

<h1>:x craftman's tools</h1>
adopt a tool only if it's positive impact on your success and happiness substantially outweighs the negative.
Simplicity is a virtue.
<p>
<h1>:x aesthetic</h1>
why is it that 'productivity gurus' seem to have converged on an aesthetic?
is the intersection of 'people who care about productivity' and 'filmmaker/writer' that small?
Does the intersection imply a certain aesthetic, or is it a group identifier?
<p>
Systems are typically presented in the <a href="style#concrete">concrete style</a>.
