terms
<ul>
<li>industry - the modern mode of industrial production of goods, producing shoes in factories and farming with pesticides
</li>
<li>craft - the traditional craft of goods, making shoes from locally sourced leather and growing your own food
</li></ul><p>
<h1>the situation</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>industry was bootstrapped from craft, which was itself bootstrapped by banging rocks together to make tools
</li>
<li>craft, once established, was relatively self sustaining, easing producing its own tools
</li>
<li>industry is now also self sustaining, as factories are built using factory produced standard parts
<ul>
<li>furthermore, toolchains are depending on ever more advanced materials (computers and modern metallurgy).
</li></ul><li>the many economic efficiencies of industry have hollowed out craft, as it is no longer profitable to be a craftsman.
<ul>
<li>industrial processes benefit from efficiencies of scale
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<p>
<h1>the horrible possibility</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>however unlikely, industry could collapse through a sufficient disruption of trade, material or energy availability, or knowledge transmission
</li>
<li>as knowledge of craft is no longer widely distributed, bootstrapping industry would be heavily delayed, even for a disruption as short as a single generation.
</li></ul><p>
<h1>a potential bet against collapse</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>keeping craft alive
<ul>
<li>through subsidy?
</li></ul><li>graceful degradation of supply chains
</li></ul><p>

<h1>:x other</h1><p>
what would it take to build a metal working shop capable of:
<ul>
<li>originating cutting tools
</li>
<li>originating precision tools (precision lathe)
</li>
<li>reproducing itself using only human labor, scrap iron and wood as inputs
</li>
<li>producing increasingly advanced and automated tools:
</li>
<li>automating the production of:
<ul>
<li>wire
</li>
<li>springs
</li>
<li>screws
</li>
<li>nails
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
how much of a gap would there be between a shop like that, and reproducing early computers?

</li>
<li>what gains could be made by having a vertically integrated hardware and software stack in the hands of an individual,
    including the tools/process needed to implement it?
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>crafting heritage
<ul>
<li>manufacturing (the production of goods, including software) lies on a spectrum between totally manual and totally automated.
<ul>
<li>by manual I mean a single person (or small group) can create some functional version of the product with locally 
      available and unrefined materials
</li></ul><li>in all industries the extreme manual end can be done with very minimal tooling
</li>
<li>in some industries, the automated end can become self-recursive / self-reliant 
<ul>
<li>using steel cauldrons to smelt steel
</li>
<li>using compiled compilers to compile compilers
</li>
<li>using computers to control the machines that make computers
</li></ul><li>for a self-reliant goods, a failure to recurse necessitates a sudden shift toward the manual end.
</li>
<li>In our current economy there is an extreme emphasis on automated production, because it scales better and is therefore more profitable.
</li>
<li>In the case of hobbyists, most only have the resources to experiment with very manual production.
</li>
<li>The middle ground is neglected. Lets call it 'semi-auto' or early industrial
</li>
<li><em>cue tinfoil hat</em>
</li>
<li>this creates a potential for failure where a good is very self-reliant but unable to recurse for a short period.
</li>
<li>in response its industry is unable to sustain itself at current levels, and cannot effectively scale back to
    early industrial levels because that 'middle knowledge' isn't actively kept by anyone.
</li>
<li>If the failure is bad enough or the good sufficiently dependent on high quality recursion, it takes more than
    a generation to recover enough semi-auto capacity to start rebuilding fully automated capacities. 
</li>
<li>at this point, not only has a generation been lost to re-industrialization, but the high end production knowledge
    has also degraded. Hopefully those running fully automated plants had the forethought to write down what they knew
    as the plants had to shut down. Hopefully that knowledge wasn't kept as an 'industry secret' for a company that
    could not possibly survive a full generation of reduced capacity.
</li>
<li><em>proceeds to solve a problem that probably doesn't exist</em>
</li>
<li>support the working class of production by seizing... this isn't a shit post I swear.
</li>
<li>create an industry conservatory that works to refine 'clean room' toolchains and regularly rebuilds tools from
    the ground up as a way to ensure that there's always someone around who has done it.
