relaxing the body while undertaking meditation will ensure that no energy is wasted. The body should be as relaxed as
appropriate in all activities.

1. find a time and a place to do this exercise so that you will not be interrupted
2. do not start if you are already stressed, drunk, high, tired, or distracted
3. before beginning just sit and relax, define your intention
4. close your eyes
5. begin by taking three deep breaths in through the nose and slowly out the mouth.
6. once you feel comfortable breathing in this manner, specifically think about how you are sitting and imagine that you
    are looking at yourself
7. now begin focusing on your toes and relax them. then the feet, relaxing your muscles. Imagine them almost melting
    away as you continue to breathe in and out. avoid a wandering mind
8. once your feet are relaxed, move on up, to each part up to the top of your head
1. as you are able to extend the relaxation of the muscles, notice that there is a calmness overcoming you. That you 
    feel good. At this point it is not unusual to feel sleepy. That's ok. it might take several attempts to get to this
    point and to be able to hold this feeling of being relaxed with out falling asleep. Be patient , be kind to yourself
1. now focus on your heart and think of relaxing your heart muscle as you slowly breath in and out. You will find that 
    your heartbeat will slow as your body releases and your breath slows.
