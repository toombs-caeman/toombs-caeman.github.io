* toastmasters
quote from the ents
something about the value of things that grow slowly and live for a long time -- jrr tolkien

Speaking is an art of giving. People give advice, commands, and consolation. Skillful speech then is to to speak in a
way that guides the audience receive the message as intended. It is what you say, *and* how you say it.

In order for the audience to understand, they first have to listen. This section will cover anti-patterns of speech
which make it difficult to listen to. Then, the four practices which will lead to more powerful speaking. 

The purpose of speaking is to trade ideas, but ideas rarely fit neatly into the words that are said.

### Other techniques and exercises
* the three second rule
    - it's a practice which sounds easy
    - simply wait three seconds after someone speaks before you speak
It gets around interrupting people, gives them some space to express, and you time to respond.
* decorate the silence
    - elizebethans used to describe conversation as decorated silence
think of words a decoration, to completely cover silence is tacky
* excessive precision
    - as an exercise, try extreme precision in language. watching out for words like 'really' or 'very'
* develop your vocabulary
    - it is frustrating to be unable to express yourself accurately
    - in the words of Dr. Jon Miller, the master of gravitas, 
        'In order to say something interesting, you've first got to know something'
    - good habits to develop vocabulary
        - read a lot
        - do crosswords
        - get a word a day app
* avoid dangerous words
    - this is a good way to practice avoiding judging, embellishment, and the passive voice
    - danger words - should, could, very, really, try, maybe, you made me(passive voice), 
        alway/never/nobody/everybody(absolutes)

### the vocal toolbox
The voice is an instrument. Besides what you say, and the words that you pick, the sound of your voice also plays a part
in how your message is received.
1. accent & timber
    * understanding - purely comprehension
    * association - south with stupid, irish brogue with being friendly, etc.

    * preference for rich, warm, smooth timbre
    * dislike scratchy, gainy, squeaky, thin, cold

2. register & prosody
    * 4 registers
        - whistle, very high
        - falsetto(not often useful)
        - modal,(head and chest) most common for speaking
            the chest provides a much more powerful sound
            people tend to vote for politicians with lower voices
        - vocal fry (not often useful)

    * prosody is intonation
    * the sing song of speech
    * expressing emotion
    * paralinguistics
    * cultural, regional, and language
    * for example, uptalk is a very weak way of speaking
    * exercise: try to communicate only using prosidy, without words, ask a question or express happiness or fear

5. pace & pitch
    * tends to go pitch
    * both tend to indicate arousal (emotional charge)
    * have a physiological effect on the heart rate of your listeners
    * deep voices are associated with authority

6. space/silence & volume
    * silence at the end of the pace/pitch spectrum
    * can add emphasis
    * much better than ums and ahhs
    * people will stick with you if you just look composed and contemplative while silent

    * careless brashness comes off as arrogant and generally moronic
    * fall quiet for emphasis, or to draw in your listeners

### public speaking
public speaking is a high risk situation, and so fear can lead to the four leeches
the antidote is to go into the situation with the correct attitude
* come from generousity
    - you are doing this for other people, the commitment is to them, not to your image
* accept them, you can't judge them
    - you don't get mad or judge an oak tree for being an oak.
* wish them well as they wish you well

### essential preparation
1. practice
    - practice speaking, not the speech
    - toastmasters is a great opportunity
2. preparation 
    - structure - know what it is
    - rehearse - practice the speech, rehearse as if for real
    - specify - specify everything you will need during the speech, (even projection format, clicker, etc)
    - check the stage on the day of
        - make sure everything is up to spec before you fill the room with people
        - it is very inelegant to deal with problems in front of the audience
        - expect the worst and have fallbacks

3. warmup voice
exercises to warm up:
    1. breathe, moan and swing your arms - opens the chest
    2. hum so loud it tickles - clears throat and vocal cords
    3. BO BO BO - warms up the lips
    4. LA LA LA - wake up the tongue
    5. rolling R - also the tongue
    6. loud SSSHHH - for the diaphram
    7. lip roll BRR - for the lips
    8. siren high to low - weeaaw - for increasing dynamic range

4. stance & gesture
amy cuddy on power posing
before getting on stage
    - power poses (open and expansie) testosterone
    - low-power poses reduce energy cortisol

on stage:
    - take a neutral stance
    - hands on the side, or hold a thumb, like the british royal family
    - avoid closed or defensive postures
    - pacing can be distracting

gestures:
    - avoid overly strong or weak gestures (pointing, pleading with the hands up) unless you really mean it
    - anchor concepts to a place on stage, past to the right, future to the left for instance

5. breath

    - breathe for nerves

6. awareness

7. structure

aids:
    1. comfort monitor
