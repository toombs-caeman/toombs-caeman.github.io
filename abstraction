<h1>do numbers exist?</h1>
is it possible for an intelligent alien species to not have the concept of numbers?
<p>
numbers are useful because the world (and life) organizes itself fractally, with many repetitions of things which (though unique in an absolute sense) are fungible to the human.
At an abstract level an 'apple' is the same as any other apple even though each apple is unique ('apple' is an abstract label that does not capture every characteristic of the 'apple' to which it refers there may be variations in color, or size). But, at the abstract level, you can say that there is 'more than one' 'apple', and <b>BOOM</b> you've got counting.
<p>
The idea of numbers (at least the natural numbers) follows pretty directly from the needs of a living organism to extract the relevant qualities from the <a href="#objects">:objects</a> around them.
<p>
what appears to be repetitive in fact cannot be so in reality, only in the abstract.
The more abstract a label, the more often it will repeat (this may or may not be practically useful)

'objects' themselves are not really a discrete thing. An apple is offgassing chemicals constantly, and the atmosphere diffuses into it. It is only conceptually distinct from its surroundings.
Is a rotted apple still an apple?
Is a chewed and digested apple still an apple?
Is an apple seed an apple?
The 'apple-ness' is not a physical thing that exists
