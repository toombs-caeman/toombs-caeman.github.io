# Conflict
* negotiation (never split the difference)

Every interaction is a negotiation, a meeting and hopefully a resolution of conflicting desires. In the highest stake situations there is no room for failure and people don't behave rationally, so rational argument and getting surface level buy in is not enough.
Compromise leaves no one happy, so no deal is better than a bad one. Do not seek compromise but a collaborative, creative solution.
Often negotiations come together through emotional catharsis or fail through emotional dis-resolution rather than depending on real terms.

Learn as much as possible about their constraints, emotional relation to the problem, and conflicting agendas they are handling. find the root desire
* draw out emotion with labelling
* wait for effect
* mirror to make them feel heard
* seek an open rapport and continued dialog rather than pushing for yes. Pushing raises the guard while NO is comforting and gives a feeling of control.

Clear the road by labelling blockers and emotions
* do an accusation audit (like eminem from 8 mile)
* summarize the blockers and root desires to get either "no it's ..." or "that's right" (both of which tell you that you're on track)
* "that's right" is the best thing you can hear while "you're right" is the worst
* suspend unbelief, it's not a competition so be open to the possibility of accepting their position.

re-define the goal
* each party must feel in control of the process, but manipulating the narrative is still possible
* turn conflict into collaborative problem solving using open ended "how" questions. Get the other side working for you.
* Fairness is a powerful motivator, but has a squishy definition. An effective card when played right
* anchor emotions to turn loss into salvaging a bad situation
* use extreme anchors to hift expectations or ranges to do the same w/ less conreteness
* give small gifts (not concessions) to earn outsized reciprocity
* use deadlines for effect

'yes' is nothing without 'how'
* the devil is in the details
* build faith that you will execute reliably
