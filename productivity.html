<h1>Productivity</h1><p>
The point of being productive is to efficiently <a href="#realize">:realize</a> what you value.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXBA4eWskrc">:If you have things you care about</a>, you should care about productivity.
<p>
<a href="style">:Stylistically</a> though, the genre of 'productivity hacks' is very much focused on the specifics of an implementation, devoid of the principles and the 'why' question. It often manages to be both too vauge to apply directly, and too specific to apply to me.
<p>
And while tips and tricks are great, they only let you go faster. It's pretty pointless if you're going in the wrong direction so figuring out what you value is more important.
<p>
Luckily the self-accountability that 'productivity' systems often create can be useful in figuring out your values, based on how you are acting currently. And if you don't like what you see, you've got the perfect hammer with which to change things.
<p>
<h1>:x realize</h1><p>
Meaning both to 'make real' and 'to comprehend'
<p>
<h2>why aren't you already optimally productive</h2><p>
There are any number of reasons plans fall through. Even when a project is <a href="#grandma">:personally important</a>.
<p>
'Productivity Proper' typically focus on preventing a few failure cases:
<ul>
<li>lack of, or fading motivation <code>6.27</code> <code>7.25</code>
</li>
<li>procrastination
</li>
<li>decision fatigue
</li>
<li>time/priority management
</li>
<li>forgetting tasks
</li>
<li>unreasonable or misaligned goals
</li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>study hacks
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Aesthetic clusters</h2><p>
A few sources of 'productivity' for <a href="style#contrast">:contrast</a>
<p>
<h3>Productivity Proper</h3><p>
The style is pretty exclusively aimed towards either personal improvement, or professional improvement (usually for executive/management types).

<p>
<h3>factory efficiency</h3><p>
There's another genre stemming from the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming">:W. E. Deming</a> speaks about techniques for factories and assembly lines. These ideas took a trip around the world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System">:through japan</a>
and then returned a few decades later in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">:american software development</a>.
While the focus and tone of the writing are slightly different, many of the same ideas pop up.

<li><a href="ifs#polarization">polarization</a>

<h2>Physical or Digital</h2><p>
There is a struggle with keeping every-thing in one place when some 'things' are digital and others physical.
It's ultimately personal whether the 'source of truth' is digital or physical.
<p>
<h2>incremental adoption, overhead, lock-in, specificity</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>does the system require a radical restructuring all at once, or can it be adopted slowly, or in part?
</li>
<li>how flexible is the system? can it adapt to all ways of life, professions?
</li>
<li>once started with a tool, how difficult is it to migrate data to a new system?
</li>
<li>what is the cost/time overhead of buying/maintaining the system?
</li></ul><p>

<h2>Productivity adjacent Systems</h2><p>

it seems like the 'systems as written' don't really work for many people. No system would work for everyone.

<li>take notes in your own words

<li>write notes as you read, watch, think in the shower, etc.

<li>simply linking or copying information is insufficient to actually learn
</li></ul><li>establish connections between new notes and your topics of interest (which should also be captured as notes).

<li>keywords are established in relation to recurring topics rather than the note in isolation

<li>or be sequences of atomic notes (a train of though), but only when the sequence itself is important to generating information.

'Deep Work' is defined as professional actions taken in an a distraction-free environment that push your cognitive abilities o the limit. This is the source of new value. This is in contrast to 'Shallow Work', such as filling out paperwork, shuffling emails, etc.

<li>actively create a distinct psychological space for focus

<li>Try to get blocks quality focus rather than trying to work longer hours

<li>embrace boredom

<li>invesitgate and drop low value behaviors

<li>do social media, entertainment, infotainment actually contribute to your goals? Do they actually help you unwind?
</li>
<li>In every moment keep in mind the value proposition of what you're doing. What goal are you working towards?
</li>
<li>be difficult to reach in order to cut down on low value interactions. Set expectations early, cut off back and forth communication/low stakes negotiation. Don't respond.

<h1>:x craftman's tools</h1><p>
adopt a tool only if it's positive impact on your success and happiness substantially outweighs the negative.
Simplicity is a virtue.
<p>
<h1>:x aesthetic</h1><p>
why is it that 'productivity gurus' seem to have converged on an aesthetic?
is the intersection of 'people who care about productivity' and 'filmmaker/writer' that small?
Does the intersection imply a certain aesthetic, or is it a group identifier?
<p>
Systems are typically presented in the <a href="style#concrete">concrete style</a>.

<h1>:x grandma</h1><p>
A few years ago my grandma was seriously ill and thought she was going to die in the hospital.
At the time the most important thing she wanted to do if she recovered was to write her memoirs.
<p>
Then she recovered and started working, but her motivation flagged here and there. Writing a book is hard.
Three years later it was finished and a small number were printed for family. My mom's a hero for helping her through that.
<p>
My point is not that she used some crazy productivity hack™, but that without help and the accountability it's probable she never would have finished.
Even though it was <b>literally her dying wish</b> (so she thought).
