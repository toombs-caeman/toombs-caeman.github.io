<h1>The Deck of Many (mini) Games</h1><p>
<p>
The deck of many games is a collection of tabletop games written on blank playing cards with sharpie, because I <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4617-deck-of-many-things">thought it would be cool</a>.
<p>
In order to be included the game should:
<ul>
<li>be fun
</li>
<li>use only common game items (playing cards, d6, pencil &amp; paper)
</li>
<li>fit on a playing card (~25 characters on ~10 lines). Ideally these condensed rules should be enough for someone who has never played before to guess at how to play &quot;correctly&quot;.
</li></ul><p>
My goal is to collect 52 such games
