<h1>Pedagogy</h1><p>
&gt; You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the basic laws on page one and then showing how they work <span class="overline"> Richard Feynman
<p>
pedagogy (teaching) is the inverse of learning, but there is asymmetry inherent in knowledge transfer, because one does not know what they don't know or what that's worth.

<li>principles of instruction (tyler) says that any course must make exclusions because any subject worth the study can't be
known in its entirety. Any principled curriculum must therefore make a political decision about what to include (the important)
and what to exclude (the less important). I will first make the principles I have used for making this choice as explicitly as I can,
in the hope that it will help you to understand why I have selected the techniques that I have.

<li>(greene) value learning above all else. Make tradeoffs for prime learning opportunities. The goal is always to develop the mind and character, not fame or fortune

The resulting pattern differs widely by context (both by application and personal preference), but it is _not_
arbitrary. The specifics of the pattern can have widely important effects, often vastly overshadowing the intent behind
the pattern. That is why understanding the ideascape underlying the application is of primary importance. Without
understanding the basics truths of the specific context, you are unlikely to do anything but stumble accidentally upon
effective patterns.
