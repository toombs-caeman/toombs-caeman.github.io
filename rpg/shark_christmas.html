I'm going to run a one-shot for my family over christmas.
It will be everyone's first experience with TTRPGs (except for me).
I think they won't be that interested in combat, won't have the patience for complicated rules,
and won't be able to sit in a chair for a 4 hour session (we may need to play from the couch).
<p>
I'm going to use this as a test run for the shark system.
<p>
So:
<ul>
<li>extremely simplified ruleset (shoot for a <lt;5 minute teach)
</li>
<li>non-violent plot
</li>
<li>pretty vanilla world-building as they're not familiar with DnD tropes.
</li>
<li>but still a satisfying introduction to the hobby
</li></ul><p>
Setting:
<ul>
<li>a few days before christmas
</li>
<li>'Santa Claus' is an inherited title.
</li>
<li>childrens nightmares come to life to get in the way of santa and the elves
<ul>
<li>toys also come to life and fend off the nightmares
</li></ul><li>for all magical beings, elf, toy, or nightmare, being seen by an adult quickly drains their 'realness'.
</li>
<li>The north pole, home to santa's workshop, yetis, elves
</li></ul><p>
Premise options:
<ul>
<li>mystery: players are workshop elves and santa is missing.
<ul>
<li>perhaps jekyll and hyde type situation with santa/krampus?
</li></ul><li>heist: players are workshop elves and santa is offloading some of his delivery work to you. It's a reverse-heist setup to deliver presents to el presidente's children.
</li></ul><p>
