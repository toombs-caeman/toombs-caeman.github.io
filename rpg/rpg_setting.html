<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2X8Zj3WGag">3x4 rule</a>
<ul>
<li>4 elements each of time (events), place (locations), and culture (what people do)
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<h1>What's a setting?</h1><p>
what makes a place feel real? How real does it need to be to make for a compelling game?
<p>
I'm not happy with the surface level classification of settings into fantasy, scifi, steampunk etc. because while aesthetics is important, loads of different stories can be told using any one of those aesthetics (though some pairings are obviously more common).
<p>
lets break down 'settings' into their constituent parts:
<ul>
<li>premise - who are the player characters, what's their archetype and what situation are they in.
<ul>
<li>what is the story <em>about</em>
</li>
<li>Is the story about the characters' personal lives, their city, their country, or the fate of their entire world?
</li></ul><li>aesthetic - steampunk, high fantasy, scifi, etc.
<ul>
<li>what is the style and feel of the world they are in?
</li></ul><li>tone - grimdark, comedy, epic heroes, scooby doo mystery, etc.
<ul>
<li>what narrative tropes are expected to come into play during the resolution of the initial premise?
</li></ul><li>narrative scopes - does the story take place over the course of a few weeks, a few years, a lifetime? Does the story track a family over 50 generations? 
<ul>
<li>day, year, lifetime, factions, world
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
My hypothesis is that these components are independent, and can be effectively mixed to generate settings tailored for the kind of play that the group wants.
<p>
aesthetic + tone shapes world building. Any world can support most premises, but premises that strongly tie to the aesthetic may be limited.
premise + narrative scope affects the choice of rule subsystems to care about. Tone may affect the choice of subsystem options, for example giving more saving throws to epic heroes than grimdark mooks.
<p>
<h1>major sections of campaign setting</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>premise - generators for situations, events, character archetypes, quests
</li>
<li>aesthetic, genre, trope, tone -  narrative tropes by aesthetic or genre
</li>
<li>scope - fractal and domain specific rule options
</li>
<li>content - generators for world building, narrative set dressing
</li>
<li>seeds - media to pull from, random ideas
</li></ul><p>
<h1>Landmasses</h1><p>
<h2>Biomes</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>topographical generation, water features
</li>
<li>biome generation?
<ul>
<li>desert, forest, tundra, sea, island, lake, rot/fungal, mountains, jungle, magical
</li>
<li>how does biome affect the generation of landmarks, monsters in that area?
</li>
<li>is there mechanical effects? speed/cost of crossing, danger level, available resources, encounters
</li></ul><li>wave function collapse by hand over a hex grid?
</li>
<li>natural vs artificial landmarks
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Planets</h2><p>
If your planet only has one or two real points of interest, just make a single biome planet like star wars and assume the rest is uninteresting. Particularly if your story is more about travel and trade between planets than surface dwelling.
<ul>
<li>planet types by major surface features
<ul>
<li>water world with d10 landmasses (earth falls into this category)
</li>
<li>hostile stony surface with rare entrances to habitable caves
</li>
<li>gas giant with d10 habitable floating landmasses
</li>
<li>hostile sands with d10 oasis and groundwater
</li>
<li>ice world with habitable equator or hot world with habitable poles
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>landmass types
<ul>
<li>archepelego - a collection of islands relatively close to each other
</li>
<li>isolated - identified by distinct culture or ecology
</li>
<li>abandoned - irradiated, never discovered, or otherwise uninhabited by sapients
</li>
<li>connected by landbridge/trade routes - distinct cultures are aware of each other through regular contact
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<h1>Species</h1><p>
Sapient creatures, monsters, animals, plants, etc.
draws heavily from stars without number.
Deal with the culture of sapients separately.
<p>
<h2>d6 intelligence level</h2><p>
<ol>
<li>mindless - the organism does not appear to react to its environment except in a very limited, reactionary context.
</li>
<li>animal - the animal can assess threats and act in its own self interest, but is unlikely to formulate long-term plans.
</li>
<li>child-like - crows for example can solve spatial puzzles, use simple tools, and transmit collective information about threats among their flock, but lack the capacity for complex language or higher order reasoning.
</li>
<li>human-like - intelligence equivalent to the playable species.
</li>
<li>hive mind or exotic - The hive may exhibit a collective consciousness with human or superhuman level intelligence, even if any individual appears mindless, lacking any individual ego. Individuals place the hive's survival above self-preservation unquestioningly. There may be other forms of non-egocentric consciousnesses.
</li>
<li>super-human - intelligence far above the playable species. The super-intelligent species may have concerns and ambitions that are incomprehensible to the less intelligent, rather than being simply more competent versions of a human-like intelligence. Behaviors that seem irrational at human scales may be perfectly rational in the long view.
</li></ol><p>
<h2>d10 ecological niche</h2><p>
There are a few theories of how to define a species' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche">ecological niche</a>.
For our purposes, the niches we care about are those that players are likely to interact with, and our definitions are with respect to how we expect that species to react to player actions. Ecological viability or completeness is only a concern inasmuch as it affects the perceived viability of the biome.
<p>
<ul>
<li>herd prey - eusocial prey that defends itself through numbers
</li>
<li>pack predator - eusocial predators that coordinate attacks against prey physically more capable
</li>
<li>swarm - like pack animals, swarms defend themselves collectively, but with less individual coordination.
</li>
<li>ambush predators - these modify the environment to lay traps, or use stealth and superior speed to hunt (spiders or tigers). Typically solitary.
</li>
<li>persistence hunter - humans, komodo dragon, some venemous snakes. Attack (and potentially poison) prey, then follow it until it cannot continue. Requires exceptional stamina and keen senses or intelligence to track the prey. Humans use the midday heat to weaken their prey rather than poison.
</li>
<li>territorial - the organism defends a territory, primarily from others of its own species. They may live alone or in pairs.
</li>
<li>parasites
</li>
<li>scavengers - don't hunt themselves, but find or steal carcasses to eat (like vultures). Need good senses and to travel long distances in order to find food.
</li>
<li>migratory - allows a species to lessen its energetic burden on a specific territory by spending less time there, or to take advantage of a safer, but less nutrient dense biome for nesting.
</li>
<li>brood parasites
</li>
<li>nuisance vermin
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Food Chain</h2><p>
Reference the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid">ecological pyramid</a>.
These categories aren't very precisely defined in the real world, as nutrients cycle around in myriad ways.
But they do have implications for how many of a species a biome will be able to support, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_cascade">ripple effects</a> you can expect from a disruption to the environment.
<p>
<ul>
<li>apex predator - that which consumes but is not threatened with consumption by others.
</li>
<li>consumers -  that which is both predator and prey, consuming both producers and/or other consumers.
<ul>
<li>parasites - a consumer that takes nutrients from its host but does not primarily aim to kill
</li></ul><li>producers - that which draws their energy from abiotic sources (rocks, sunlight, volcanic heat, raw mana).
</li>
<li>decomposers - that which recycles already-dead organic material to make it more readily available to producers.
</li>
<li>biogenic diseases / infection - arguably a type of microscopic parasite
</li>
<li>symbiotes - that which (usually or always) exists very closely with another species
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Evolution</h2><p>
potential causes for rapid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_radiation">evolutionary radiation</a>
<ul>
<li>a species aquires a key trait that allows them access to new ecological niches
</li>
<li>increased geographic isolation allows many variations to develop
</li>
<li>co-adaptive arms race between predator and prey
</li>
<li>mass extinction can rapidly open available niches to a new clade.

<h2>Filling Cities (beak, feather + bone) (BFP SRD)</h2><p>
players take on the role of various factions vying for power.
choose an impressive location to be the 'center of power'
take turns drawing cards and selecting locations on a map (marking that location w/ your color):
<ul>
<li>the suit indicates the general purpose of a location (social, financial, future, past)
</li>
<li>the value indicates the 'power' that the location gives to the faction
</li>
<li>on face cards: create an NPC of another faction that opposes the purpose of this location
<ul>
<li>beak: What is your rival’s reputation?
</li>
<li>feather: What is your rival’s appearance?
</li>
<li>bone: What is your rival’s true motivation?
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
write down three aspects of that location
<ul>
<li>beak - what people are saying about this location
</li>
<li>feather - what the location looks like
</li>
<li>bone - what is actually going on inside (literally or not)
</li></ul><p>
the faction with the most 'power' whenever you stop claims the 'center of power'.
Go for any number of rounds, until the map is filled, or until the cards run out.

<li>create eras: time periods between the bookends and place them along the timeline (names like 'the enlightenment', 'the dark ages', 'rise of the nanobots')
</li>
<li>create events: things which happen. may be placed in eras
</li>
<li>run a few scenes: a 'lens' poses a question, and sets the scene, noting a few characters who are present. Others elect to take on those roles and continue freeform improv until the question is answered.

<h1>Dungeon Design</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>structure
</li>
<li>narrative purpose
</li>
<li>in-world purpose
</li></ul><p>
<h2>room design</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>I thought it would be cool to reference the Art of War chapter on terrain, but it's a bit weird.
<ul>
<li>accessible ground - freely traversed by both sides
</li>
<li>entangling ground - that which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy, if you advance from here you cannot retreat
        just beyond the point of no return. There you must succeed or die.
</li>
<li>temporizing ground - where neither side gains by moving first (a standoff)
</li>
<li>narrow passes - where the entrenched side has an advantage (not easily regained once given up).
</li>
<li>precipitous heights - occupy the high ground, or lure the enemy away if they have it
</li>
<li>positions at great distance from the enemy - do not march forward, to meet the enemy while you are tired and the enemy is fresh
</li></ul><li>ICRPG room obstacles
<ul>
<li>barrier - a wall, chasm, barricade, fence, etc. which must be crossed
</li>
<li>tangle - deep mud, glue, grappling vines, etc. which hinder movement and entangle
</li>
<li>lock - not necessarily a literal lock and key, think of zelda fetch quests
</li>
<li>kite - an unbeatable enemy must be lured out of the way, or away from its healers to get past or defeat it.
</li>
<li>pinch - a narrow pass, chokepoint, etc.
</li>
<li>ambush - hidden enemies around a corner, or hidden in the trees
</li>
<li>siege - a battle of attrition against an entrenched enemy
</li>
<li>tightrope - a clumsy tumble would put you in a tough spot below
</li>
<li>duel - the classic boss room, where the door locks until the boss is dead.
