Here I'll list rpg settings, works of fiction, historical settings, etc. which I think could be interesting for a campaign.
<p>
<p>
<h1>examples</h1><p>
Take the world of Dune. You're party could be:
<ul>
<li>advisors to a house, vying for power internally while still advancing the goals of the house
</li>
<li>fremen, leading the resistance against the harkonnens
</li>
<li>a sardaukar suicide squad
</li>
<li>scions of allied houses, coming together for a larger political play
</li>
<li>members of the spacing guild
</li></ul><p>
but that world doesn't lend much to the story of a scrappy crew of scoundrels, the way Duskvol from Blades in the Dark does.
<p>
On the other hand, take the premise of the scrappy crew of scoundrels hanging around the edges:
<ul>
<li>in steampunk setting thats Blades in the Dark
</li>
<li>in scifi it's Firefly
</li>
<li>in high fantasy it's a DnD party full of rogues
</li>
<li>in a historical setting it's pirates
</li></ul><p>
<h1>wild settings (primalpunk?)</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>mausritter, household
</li>
<li>blood &amp; snow
</li>
<li>belly of the beast
</li>
<li>wildsea
</li>
<li>horizon zero dawn
</li>
<li>degenesis
</li></ul><p>
<h1>scifi settings</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>diamond age - neovictorian nanopunks in a world fractured into many cultures
</li>
<li>dune imperium - cutthroat feudal politics in space
</li>
<li>firefly - scrappy space cowboys
</li>
<li>blade runner - the nature of humanity in a grim technoir future
</li>
<li>war of the worlds
</li>
<li>mecha - giant robots. fuck yeah (lancer?)
</li></ul><p>
<h1>confluence / magitech</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>TVA - protectors of the timeline/multiverse
</li>
<li>warp shell - space whale ships mix with magic and technology
</li>
<li>gate - a portal to a world of magic opens in modern day detroit
</li>
<li>shadowrun - gritty urban magitech
</li></ul><p>
<h1>survival/horror</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>suicide squad / viking death squad
</li>
<li>crash on a desert island
</li>
<li>zombie apocalypse
</li>
<li>the 100 - different human clans reunite on earth after 1000 year refuge from nuclear radiation
</li>
<li>alien vs predator
</li></ul><p>
<h1>military</h1><p>
tbh the system won't have enough crunch for real intense historical accuracy.
<ul>
<li>pentagon politics - play as the politicians and commanders rather than soldiers
</li>
<li>roman legionaires - lost beyond hadrians wall perhaps
</li>
<li>pirates at tortuga / port royal - arr matey
</li></ul><p>
<h1>cosmic horror</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>there is no antimemetics division
</li>
<li>anything cthulhu/lovecraft related
</li>
<li>i have no mouth and i must scream
</li></ul><p>
<h1>urban fantasy</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>dresden files
</li>
<li>mistborn
</li>
<li>vampire the masquerade
</li>
<li>office workers for a magitech company - scrolls inc. (the office + 80s tech optimism but for magic + cosmic horror?)
</li>
<li>isekai shokudan - running a chill restaurant for odd non-human patrons
</li></ul><p>
<h1>superhero</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>teen titans
</li>
<li>the boys
</li></ul><p>
<h1>high fantasy</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>forgotten realms
</li>
<li>mage the ascension
</li></ul><p>
<h1>ghosts and automatons</h1><p>
The dead cannot lie, and do not grow or learn.
A character that dies may persist as a ghost or undead.
They lose the skill 'Do anything', so they may only act as they did in life.
They lose all XP and cannot not gain any more.
<p>
Automatons similarly may exhibit complex behaviors (skills), but do not act outside their programming, so do not have 'Do Anything'.
<p>
<h1>magic systems</h1><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oelOVHL9awQ">hard/soft,diverse/unified magic systems</a>
<p>
mechanics (player understanding) and metaphysics (character understanding)
<p>
is 'wizardry' an academic practice that requires extensive study, a profession on its own, or is it incorporated in whatever lifestyle and job. related to how pervasive and diverse it is.
<p>
elemental interactions beyond just extra damage/resistance (genshin impact)
vancian(memorize), vancian(prepared), mana-fueled, mage the ascension

<p>
practical kabbalah
voodoo

<p>
phistelogen
aristotlean physics
<p>
methods of obtaining magic
<ul>
<li>emotion - stong emotions elicit a response by magical forces, or those forces are inherently emotive
</li>
<li>vision - having a strong ambition, vision, or drive inherently enables magic (genshin impact)
</li>
<li>inborn - being born with a genetic predisposition (probably recessive) or a magical race
</li>
<li>bestowal - a supernatural being bestows, gifts, or gives in contract magic to an otherwise non-magical being
</li>
<li>material - magic is controlled or obtained through a substance which governs the level of power that can be channeled, but not the form that the magic takes (otherwise it would just be science).
<ul>
<li>consumption - the material is a fuel, either burned or ingested
</li>
<li>conduit - the material is a catalyst
</li></ul><li>cultural
<ul>
<li>language - words or other symbols of power that shape the world. the primary limitation is knowledge, rather than some other method of power limiting.
</li>
<li>ancestral - knowledge of, and ritual reverence to the ancestry
</li></ul><li>epistemology - your view (or a subcultures collective view) of reality warps reality to fit their expectation/faith
<ul>
<li>fame - receiving the faith/expectation of others empowers you magically
</li>
<li>gratitude - receiving gratitude of others empowers you magically
</li>
<li>artistry - that which is beautiful has power, so the creation of art is a kind of spellcasting.
</li></ul><li>symbiotic - the magic comes from a symbiosis or exposure to environmental toxin
</li>
<li>sacrifice - giving up the flesh, lifeforce, memories, or other intangible bits of the self to obtain or channel power.
<ul>
<li>tattoo based
</li></ul><li>celestial - linked to the movement of the stars
</li></ul><p>
<p>
narrative problems with elemental magic:
<ul>
<li>cliche personality pairings
</li>
<li>cliche weakness/resistance pairings
</li>
<li>cliche 4 elements (platonic) - what about the periodic table? eastern elementalism. is darkness an element? MtG.
</li></ul><p>
narrative problems with magic:
<ul>
<li>all wizards are professional wizards
</li></ul><p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>blood magic
<ul>
<li>what happens when a mage runs out of their normal casting resources? Are they reduced to picking up a sharp stick for defense?
</li>
<li>I think it's cooler if the mage can also cast using their HP when things get really desperate, but maybe this is an ability restricted to a specific class.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
animism - spirit contracting? or simply making offerings to a spirit
In a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">vancian magic</a> system the mage must prepare spells ahead of time, and 'forgets' the spells they know after use. d&amp;d uses a derivative of this.
