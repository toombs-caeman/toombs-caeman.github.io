Here I'll list rpg settings, works of fiction, historical settings, etc. which I think could be interesting for a campaign.
<p>
<p>
<h1>examples</h1><p>
Take the world of Dune. You're party could be:
<ul>
<li>advisors to a house, vying for power internally while still advancing the goals of the house
</li>
<li>fremen, leading the resistance against the harkonnens
</li>
<li>a sardaukar suicide squad
</li>
<li>scions of allied houses, coming together for a larger political play
</li>
<li>members of the spacing guild
</li></ul><p>
but that world doesn't lend much to the story of a scrappy crew of scoundrels, the way Duskvol from Blades in the Dark does.
<p>
On the other hand, take the premise of the scrappy crew of scoundrels hanging around the edges:
<ul>
<li>in steampunk setting thats Blades in the Dark
</li>
<li>in scifi it's Firefly
</li>
<li>in high fantasy it's a DnD party full of rogues
</li>
<li>in a historical setting it's pirates
</li></ul><p>
<h1>wild settings (primalpunk?)</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>mausritter, household
</li>
<li>blood &amp; snow
</li>
<li>belly of the beast
</li>
<li>wildsea
</li>
<li>horizon zero dawn
</li>
<li>degenesis
</li></ul><p>
<h1>scifi settings</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>diamond age - neovictorian nanopunks in a world fractured into many cultures
</li>
<li>dune imperium - cutthroat feudal politics in space
</li>
<li>firefly - scrappy space cowboys
</li>
<li>blade runner - the nature of humanity in a grim technoir future
</li>
<li>war of the worlds
</li>
<li>mecha - giant robots. fuck yeah (lancer?)
</li></ul><p>
<h1>confluence / magitech</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>TVA - protectors of the timeline/multiverse
</li>
<li>warp shell - space whale ships mix with magic and technology
</li>
<li>gate - a portal to a world of magic opens in modern day detroit
</li>
<li>shadowrun - gritty urban magitech
</li></ul><p>
<h1>survival/horror</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>suicide squad / viking death squad
</li>
<li>crash on a desert island
</li>
<li>zombie apocalypse
</li>
<li>the 100 - different human clans reunite on earth after 1000 year refuge from nuclear radiation
</li>
<li>alien vs predator
</li></ul><p>
<h1>military</h1><p>
tbh the system won't have enough crunch for real intense historical accuracy.
<ul>
<li>pentagon politics - play as the politicians and commanders rather than soldiers
</li>
<li>roman legionaires - lost beyond hadrians wall perhaps
</li>
<li>pirates at tortuga / port royal - arr matey
</li></ul><p>
<h1>cosmic horror</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>there is no antimemetics division
</li>
<li>anything cthulhu/lovecraft related
</li>
<li>i have no mouth and i must scream
</li></ul><p>
<h1>urban fantasy</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>dresden files
</li>
<li>mistborn
</li>
<li>vampire the masquerade
</li>
<li>office workers for a magitech company - scrolls inc. (the office + 80s tech optimism but for magic + cosmic horror?)
</li>
<li>isekai shokudan - running a chill restaurant for odd non-human patrons
</li></ul><p>
<h1>superhero</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>teen titans
</li>
<li>the boys
</li></ul><p>
<h1>high fantasy</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>forgotten realms
</li>
<li>mage the ascension
</li></ul><p>
<h1>ghosts and automatons</h1><p>
The dead cannot lie, and do not grow or learn.
A character that dies may persist as a ghost or undead.
They lose the skill 'Do anything', so they may only act as they did in life.
They lose all XP and cannot not gain any more.
<p>
Automatons similarly may exhibit complex behaviors (skills), but do not act outside their programming, so do not have 'Do Anything'.
<p>
<h1>magic systems</h1><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oelOVHL9awQ">hard/soft,diverse/unified magic systems</a>
<p>
mechanics (player understanding) and metaphysics (character understanding)
<p>
is 'wizardry' an academic practice that requires extensive study, a profession on its own, or is it incorporated in whatever lifestyle and job. related to how pervasive and diverse it is.
<p>
elemental interactions beyond just extra damage/resistance (genshin impact)

<p>

<p>
methods of obtaining magic
<ul>
<li>emotion - stong emotions elicit a response by magical forces, or those forces are inherently emotive
</li>
<li>vision - having a strong ambition, vision, or drive inherently enables magic (genshin impact)
</li>
<li>inborn - being born with a genetic predisposition (probably recessive) or a magical race
</li>
<li>bestowal - a supernatural being bestows, gifts, or gives in contract magic to an otherwise non-magical being
</li>
<li>material - magic is controlled or obtained through a substance which governs the level of power that can be channeled, but not the form that the magic takes (otherwise it would just be science).
<ul>
<li>consumption - the material is a fuel, either burned or ingested
</li>
<li>conduit - the material is a catalyst
</li></ul><li>cultural
<ul>
<li>language - words or other symbols of power that shape the world. the primary limitation is knowledge, rather than some other method of power limiting.
</li>
<li>ancestral - knowledge of, and ritual reverence to the ancestry
</li></ul><li>epistemology - your view (or a subcultures collective view) of reality warps reality to fit their expectation/faith
<ul>
<li>fame - receiving the faith/expectation of others empowers you magically
</li>
<li>gratitude - receiving gratitude of others empowers you magically
</li>
<li>artistry - that which is beautiful has power, so the creation of art is a kind of spellcasting.
</li></ul><li>symbiotic - the magic comes from a symbiosis or exposure to environmental toxin
</li>
<li>sacrifice - giving up the flesh, lifeforce, memories, or other intangible bits of the self to obtain or channel power.
<ul>
<li>tattoo based
</li></ul><li>celestial - linked to the movement of the stars
</li></ul><p>
<p>
narrative problems with elemental magic:
<ul>
<li>cliche personality pairings
</li>
<li>cliche weakness/resistance pairings
</li>
<li>cliche 4 elements (platonic) - what about the periodic table? eastern elementalism. is darkness an element? MtG.
</li></ul><p>
narrative problems with magic:
<ul>
<li>all wizards are professional wizards
</li></ul><p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>blood magic
<ul>
<li>what happens when a mage runs out of their normal casting resources? Are they reduced to picking up a sharp stick for defense?
</li>
<li>I think it's cooler if the mage can also cast using their HP when things get really desperate, but maybe this is an ability restricted to a specific class.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
animism - spirit contracting? or simply making offerings to a spirit
In a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">vancian magic</a> system the mage must prepare spells ahead of time, and 'forgets' the spells they know after use. d&amp;d uses a derivative of this.

<h1>Playable Species</h1><p>
Here's a possible list of playable species. Each of these are of more or less human-like sapience and size, if not body plan.
<p>
Many of the species described here have many different versions coming from many media. In order to not repeat myself, I'll cut out all waffling.
Just imagine when I say anything about these species, what I mean to say is that &quot;typically&quot; or &quot;often&quot; that is how they have been represented. The point of discussing species here isn't to say that the species must have these physical or cultural aspects in your game, but to say that these names come along with a built-in understanding that your players may be familiar with (and that you can leverage).
If your players don't already know what elves are, then it doesn't matter what you call your species of knife-eared forest dwellers. On the otherhand, if they do know, it would be weird to call a species of ugly fish-people elves since it gives the wrong impression.
<p>
As another point, it's a little reductive from a worldbuilding point of view for each species to have a single stereotypical culture, personality, skillset, or job, especially if that species is dispersed geographically or comprises a fully functioning society (which together probably covers all cases). However, from a gameplay perspective stereotypes can help players quickly get a read on an NPC and one cultural stereotype is probably enough for your game.
<p>
<h1>tzelicrae (wildsea)</h1><p>
An individual Tzelicrae is a swarm of spiders a single hive-mind and human level intelligence.
The swarm typically takes on a humanoid form when interacting with other humanoid species by creating and inhabiting a 'skin'.
The quality and body structure of the skin are highly variable with the only real constraints being available materials and that the skin is a suitable size for the colony.
<p>
The Tzelicrae are 'born' when a swarm develops its own individual ego.
They can convincingly imitate other species of a similiar size by 'acquiring' a skin from that species, though some care needs to be taken in preparing it.
Even when walking in a skin they've made themselves (which is much more common) their culture is a mishmash of pieces borrowed from the other cultures they find themselves in.
<p>
The individual spiders that make up the true body of a Tzelicrae may be of many different species and will die and be replaced regularly.
Losing &gt;10% of the swarm at once is harmful to them, temporarily impairing cognition and causing permanent memory loss, but the loss is rarely fatal unless over 60% of the swarm is lost.
<p>
Tzelicrae society centers around their Huskpas, massive silk monuments inhabited by spiders from all Tzelicrae that have lived there. It serves as a psychic connection to the greater hive and a repository of memories. Their language, Knock, has many forms spoken, signed, or tapped to accomodate the varied capabilities among their brethren.
<p>
<p>
<h1>elves</h1><p>
long lived humanoids associated with elegance, beauty and the forest.
Their build is tall and slender, appearing human except for having pointed ears and a supernatural grace.
<p>
known for:
<ul>
<li>beauty - most humanoid races see them as supernaturally beautiful
</li>
<li>long lived and small numbers
</li>
<li>archer
</li>
<li>magic
</li>
<li>education - as a long lived race, they tend to master many arts, especially music
</li>
<li>insular - aloof from worldly affairs, especially those of humans. They see humans as mayflies, living not even a season and of no significance.
</li></ul><p>
<h2>elvish subraces</h2><p>
in some media, elves are known for quickly expressing a phenotype adapted to the environment in which they live, creating many subraces with elemental and environmental attributes.
For example, while elves are typically associated with the forest, a clan of elves living on an active volcano will develop dark skin tones, red eyes, a strong temper, and an affinity for fire magic within a few generations (though those 'few generations' might seem like a long time to the short lived races).
This is sometimes contrasted to humans who won't change phenotypes, but who are notorious for having extremely adaptable and variable personalities. Accordingly, both races are found in all manner of environments.
<p>
<h2>half-elves</h2><p>
humans are often compatible with elf biology, though half-elves are often pushed out by both sides.
There is often stigma, but also an issue of lifespan. The half-elves never live long enough to be considered adults by the elves, but mature too quickly to be seen as children. On the otherhand, the half-elves will certainly outlive all of their human friends by a few times over, and find difficulty in forming close relationships.
<p>
<h1>dwarves</h1><p>
Dwarves are long-lived, but short and stout humanoids associated with mountains and caves.
They have great craftsmen, especially blacksmiths, and take great pride in their beards. The women have beards too.
<p>
<h2>crafting children</h2><p>
Dwarvish myth holds that the first dwarves were carved from stone by their god
<p>
<p>
<h1>Draconids / Drakes</h1><p>
The (self-proclaimed) descendents of dragons, now humanoid and lacking wings.
Those that retain the ability to breath fire have a higher social standing.
This is a separate ancestry from the lizardfolk, and they are easily offended when that gets confused by outsiders.
Like dragons they have a healthy love for gold and hot climates.
<p>
<h1>lizardfolk</h1><p>
Physically these appear much like drakes to outsiders, but they never have the inate ability to breathe fire.
Typically live in wet, swampy areas and have a relatively primitive culture
<h1>snake-men</h1><p>
The snakemen are associated with necromancy, betrayal, and visually with the culture of ancient Egypt.
<p>
<a href="https://enstargate.fandom.com/wiki/Goa%27uld">Goa'uld</a>
<p>
<h1>Kobold</h1><p>
Kobolds are small and weak but cunning, little more than a nuisance unless in a pack.
Kobolds are either reptilian (DnD) or mammalian, though the word is from the same german root as Goblin or Gremlin (and cobalt).
<p>
<h1>Goblins</h1><p>
Small and weak green-skinned humanoids that are always hungry and grubby. They aren't very smart and cannot use normal magic, but their shamans are quite powerful.
Goblins have a small chance to change into 'Hobgoblins' becoming as tall as a human and more muscular, though still stupid.
<p>
Usually a small yet persistent nuisance, occasionally a goblin king will rise to unite the scattered tribes and cause a wave of devastation as they multiply rapidly and sweep the lands looking to loot and pillage.
<p>
When used as a playable species, the negative aspects are usually played off as simply stereotypes or as the result of discrimination forcing goblins into poverty and petty crime. Fantasy games often use goblins as cannon fodder enemies, so it may become a little uncomfortable for players and PCs to acknowledge the people you've been murdering as people.
<p>
<h1>Ents</h1><p>
Sentient trees that are extremely long-winded and slow to action (though not physically slow) and can be large.
Their young hide, pretending to be trees until full grown. All ents are indistinguishable from normal trees when stationary to everyone but other Ents.
Their language is indistinguishable from the sound of wind through the trees, but is very slow to speak.
<p>
Generally they are highly communal and don't travel far from where they are born, but the adventuring Ent is never your typical Ent.
<p>
<h2>Ektus (wildsea)</h2><p>
A prickly cactus people from the desert.
<p>
<h1>mycolids</h1><p>
Fungal people with widely variable body plans and toxic or healing properties. possibly a hive mind.
The variety of real-world fungi is absolutely wild and often underexplored in games. Its hard to say anything about 'typical' representation of fungal races, so I recommend just looking up a few to get inspiration.
In the real world, the mushroom that we typically think of as the fungus is actually just the fruit, a sexual organ. The true body of the fungus is the mycelium underground, which may have many fruits. Because of this the mycelial network can be thought of as the 'true body' mushroom-like body that most humanoid races would interact with is simply a remote controlled clonal body.
<p>
Another way to handle it is that the mycelial network is contained within the mycolids body and may be fed through a normal-looking 'eating' of food to decay inside the body.The outer body could be shed and regenerated as long as the core isn't damaged. This would need to be done regularly, once a year or once a season.
<p>
<h1>Orcs</h1><p>
<h1>warhammer 40k orcs</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>fungal species
</li>
<li>size == intelligence
</li>
<li>generally stupid + belief warping local reality
</li></ul><p>
<h1>stitch folk (wandering inn)</h1><p>
A people made of living cotton, silk or other fabric made flesh through the magic of a lifethread.
Body parts can be easily removed for repairs. Removed parts revert to cloth. They are especially vulnerable to fire.
Body modification is easy when the materials are available, but it must be done slowly, and the lifethread can't be replaced.
Its very typical for a stitchfolk to dye themselves, to have embroidery tattoos, or to give themselves a peak physique.
Also, modification of the internal organs requires extensive medical knowledge, since the stitched or feltwork piece must accurately model a true organ in order to function correctly. As a result many stitch-folk (and all who wish to be parents) are highly accomplished doctors.
Children are made by a pair of stitch-folk by stitching a complete body and inserting a new lifethread. It's a time consuming and elaborate process.
<p>
A rough class system exists regarding the quality of material one is made from. Cotton is most typical. Rougher fabrics result in noticable fabric texture and rough features when made flesh. It's a constant debate in their culture of whether to hide their stitches or display them proudly.
<p>
Stitch-folk were originally created by a wizard who attempted to give them limited autonomy thereby creating the perfect slaves. It didn't work and they have a difficult relationship with their creator. 
<p>
<h1>animism</h1><p>
Some traditions (shinto, taoist, etc.) hold that any object that reaches sufficient age (100, 1000, or 10,000 years) will gain a spirit or sentience.
In particular, household or beloved personal objects, medical herbs, weapons, animals, and trees are prone to this.
