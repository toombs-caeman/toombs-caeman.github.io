<p>
This section is for those who want to rewrite, expand, trim up, or otherwise modify this game.
<p>
In a sense with this system you are designing your own game any time you choose your own setting and optional rules.
However, you may want to swap out the core rules, or drastically change how the game is presented. Presentation matters, and a more integrated and streamlined approach can be easier to write and to digest.
<p>
This game is presented in such a way that the system is separate from any setting and the system itself is as modular as possible with many parts being optional or having multiple possible implementations. However it may make sense for you to select a subset of the rules, and present them as a single thing, intertwining a definitive rule set with a setting.
<p>
Additionally, the optional rules presented here are by no means exhaustive. You may find that they don't offer enough in a domain that matters for your game, or that the rules that are there kinda suck.
<p>
Here are some considerations for creating your own rules.
<p>
<h1>Fun First</h1><p>
Playtest your game. If it isn't fun, change it. Don't be afraid to kill your darling ideas.
<p>
<h1>Ease &amp; complexity</h1><p>
Adding complexity can enable more nuanced play, but this needs to be balanced with the system's ease of use.
It's easy to add too much to the game, and then get bogged down. On the other hand, systems without crunch can feel reductive.
<p>
<ul>
<li>speed at the table is a feature
</li>
<li>easy prep is a feature (for the GM)
</li>
<li>a quick teach is a feature
</li>
<li>having few things to remember is a feature
</li>
<li>consistent rules and terminology is a feature
</li>
<li>how many types of things can trigger an ability? How often do GMs or players forget to trigger some rule?
</li>
<li>how complicated are characters? How long does it take to understand how to play a class/archetype?
</li>
<li>how many exceptions to a rule are there (player abilities are often exceptions)?
</li></ul><p>
<h1>Incentives</h1><p>
what kinds of play are encouraged by the rules? What is discouraged?
Does a a rule mitigate a distruptive strategy at an administrative cost to everyone?
<p>
<h2>types of rules</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>know the difference between rules, conventions and advice. make the distinction clear to your readers.
</li>
<li>core rules are constantly used, usually around how and when dice are rolled. These should be as tight and simple as possible.
</li>
<li>excecptions are things which bend hard rules (like FATE stunts).
</li>
<li>hard rules have clear edges. if THIS then THAT, always (unless there's an exeption).
<ul>
<li>hard rules allow the game to be consistent, fair, and fast.
</li>
<li>the core rules are usually hard.
</li>
<li>the rules that PvP (or rather PC vs PC) conflict should always be hard to maximize perceived fairness.
</li></ul><li>soft rules are those applied with discretion.
<ul>
<li>abilities that players may choose to use, or whenever a GM may choose to reward a player for good roleplay.
</li>
<li>It can be tricky to do so 'fairly' as a GM but their softness give leeway to handle unexpected corner cases, which is a boon for both GM and designers. The ultimate soft rule is 'GM fiat', whereby the GM <em>can</em> do anything with the game (not that they necessarily should).
</li>
<li>this includes catchall rules to handle creative thinking by the player that <em>should</em> work, but for which there is no extant rule
</li></ul><li>interpersonal
<ul>
<li>balancing mechanical power between players (balanced character creation)
</li>
<li>handling distruptive player dynamics at the table (hogging the spotlight, or derailing the experience).
</li>
<li>resolving interpersonal conflict at the table is tricky, and usually what is said about it without context, in a book about a game no less, should likely be general advice rather than hard rules.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<h1>Using Other Dice Systems</h1><p>
how do other dice do?
<ul>
<li>how random are things? can your players form effective plans or are they constantly thwarted by chance
<a href="dicemath.html">dicemath</a>
</li></ul><p>
<h1>presentation</h1><p>
<ul>
<li>good layout / page design is a feature
</li>
<li>lead with the most important information. Stuff that rarely comes up should be hidden in the back.
<ul>
<li>don't be afraid to scatter information about a topic all over the place, but if you do, include a summary with everything.
</li></ul><li>strongly separate player and GM sections.
<ul>
<li>how much does a new player need to read (and grok) to be able to start playing?
</li>
<li>the player section should be short and sweet
</li>
<li>players don't need to understand how to set roll targets.
</li></ul><li>consistency is a feature
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Why have a GM?</h2><p>
GM-less RPGs exist (so do solo games) but in the end 'someone' needs to lend reality to the world in which the PCs exist, whether that comes from the GM or the games author, through encounter tables or something. The GM also adjudicates the soft rules.
There are different kinds of fun available while playing as a GM or as a 'player'. While it can be hard to find both sorts of folk at the same table, both sorts of fun are valid.
<p>
<h2>Why do we need rules to come together and tell a compelling story?</h2><p>
Some things show up in any good story. Conflict for example. Rules are a handy way to resolve that conflict, that obviates the need for fisticuffs, absolves the GM of culpability, and more fairly distributes control of the narrative.
