I'm going to run a one-shot for my family over christmas.
It will be everyone's first experience with TTRPGs (except for me).
I think they won't be that interested in combat, won't have the patience for complicated rules,
and won't be able to sit in a chair for a 4 hour session (we may need to play from the couch).

I'm going to use this as a test run for the shark system.

So:
* extremely simplified ruleset (shoot for a <5 minute teach)
* non-violent plot
* pretty vanilla world-building as they're not familiar with DnD tropes.
* but still a satisfying introduction to the hobby

Setting:
* The north pole, home to santa's workshop, yetis, elves
* a few days before christmas

Premise options:
* mystery: players are workshop elves and santa is missing.
    * perhaps jekyll and hyde type situation with santa/krampus?
* heist: players are workshop elves and santa is offloading some of his delivery work to you. It's a reverse-heist setup to deliver presents to el presidente's children.

# player facing rules (the teach).

stats:
* cheer - magic and hope
* charisma - persuasion and deception
* strength - physical power
