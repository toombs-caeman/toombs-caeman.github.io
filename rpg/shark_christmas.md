# A Christmas RPG
I'm going to run a short one-shot for my family over christmas.
It will be everyone's first experience with TTRPGs (except for me).
I need to teach the rules, introduce the setting, create characters and play all within about 2 hours.

I need a ruleset thats simple and fast to run and to teach.
So I'm going to use this as a test run for the shark system.
I am lucky enough that my usual group is willing to run a test session ahead of time, but I only get one shot to test it.

# the teach
1. the world
2. who your characters are and what they're up to
3. the rules of the game
4. character creation
5. starting scene

# The Setting
This world is much like our own, circa 2000, at least on the surface.

Below the surface however, collective beliefs have the power warp reality. If enough people truly believe something, then reality bends to fit their view. This gives rise to all sorts of supernatural beings but also forces them to hide themselves from the average human.
After all, most people believe the world to be a very normal place so the 'Laws of Normalcy' has the power to potentially erase a supernatural being from existence if its ever noticed by an adult human. The more impossible a thing seems to the human and the more humans that see, the stronger the force of erasure.

Life as a supernatural being is always in tension between these two needs:
1. to be seen, thereby creating new true-believers to sustain your kind long term, and
2. to remain hidden, and individually safe from erasure.

# premise

You are elves of santa's workshop at the north pole.
This year you have been assigned a new mission; Since santa no longer has the power to visit every house in a single evening, he has enlisted you too make the journey and deliver presents.

The job is a bit dangerous. The adults will, at best, think you are robbing them, and the houses you enter are not only occupied by humans. Pets and toys may assist your endeavors, and nightmares oppose you as part of their ongoing struggle within the household.

You begin just outside the first house on your schedule.

## alt premise
The players return to the workshop and santa is missing.
* perhaps jekyll and hyde type situation with santa/krampus?

# The Teach
Your characters will have attributes, skills, items, and possibly negative consequences.

* Attributes are a reserve of strength which the character may draw on to avoid serious consequences or to push themselves to succeed.
* Skills are the things that the character is good at.
* Items are the things the character is carrying around.
* Consequences are injuries and exhaustion, anything which may prevent the character from doing their best work.
## rolling
If you want to do something you can obviously do, say so and then you do it.
When success or failure is in question, roll a number of dice equal to your skill level plus one for any situational advantage and minus one for any disadvantage.
The highest die you roll determines the outcome: 6 is a success, 5 is a mixed success (yes but). Other results are a failure, but you gain one XP.
When counting effort, any dice 4 or higher is counted, as long as you have at least one success or mixed success.

# attributes, pips & consequences
You have 3 attributes:
* cheer - belief in the christmas spirit, which powers your magic and keeps you going
* charm - affability, perception and deception
* chonk - physical strength, robustness and rotundness

Each attribute is a pool of resources called 'pips' and can hold as many pips as the level of that attribute.

You can spend pips to increase the face of any die you roll.
You can also spend 2 pips to add a die to your roll.
If there is a hit against you, you must offset that hit by spending 3 pips or by taking a consequence.
Each consequence is a description of the damage that you take, and counts as one disadvantage if narratively it would impede any future rolls. Consequences can be removed by rolling against the total number of consequences you have and then resting.

## skills
Everyone gets "do anything 1"

The following are level 2 skills, categorized by their associated attributes.
* charm
    * provoke - annoying or angering
    * empathy - being liked and trusted
    * deceive - lying, etc.
    * notice  - noticing hidden things, socially or otherwise
* chonk
    * acrobatics - feats of physical finesse
    * strength - moving and breaking stuff, feats of physical force
    * crafts - making improvised tools
    * fighting - melee or ranged combat
* cheer
    * mischief - a criminal element, only in the spirit of christmas of course
    * stealth - remaining unseen
    * magic - anything superpowered
    * assist - give an advantage to your companions

## character creation
Choose a name, what you normally work on in the workshop, and your hobby outside of work.
Pick three items which you think will be useful on your journey.
You have 18 XP to spend on skills or attributes. Each level of an attribute costs 1XP and each skill costs its level in XP (a level 2 skill costs 2XP). Skills bought this way can be up to level 3.

You can learn additional skills by doing stuff: roll to do something then spending 1 XP for every non-6 that you've rolled. The skill you learn will be a subset of the skill you used to roll and at one level higher. If you roll all 6s you automatically learn a new skill.

You can also spend 2XP to gain an attribute level or to do a flashback.

# flashbacks
By having a flashback you can say that actually you did prepare for this situation "off camera" or have some relevant experience.
A flashback cannot contradict anything that has already been established at the table.

# Additional rules that might come up but that don't need to be taught upfront
* if you are hit with less than 3 pips, lose any remaining pips but don't take a consequence.
* heal chonk by eating, charm by freshening up, cheer by feeling the christmas spirit. You can heal pretty much anything with a quick nap in a safe spot.
    * the auto-sleigh is perfect for a nap, but someone has to stay awake to pilot it and can't always heal.
* if you have to roll but have <=0 dice then roll 2d6 and take the lower result

# Extra Setting Stuff
* even among the supernatural, most people are not aware of the true power of belief. Only the especially old and powerful can directly change the world through their own willpower, though the many forms of lesser magic and supernatural abilities can be said to be an implicit form of the same power.
* 'Awakening' an adult human so that they can safely view the supernatural is a slow and dangerous process for everyone involved. It is much easier (though still dangerous) to draw belief from children children.
* trolls gained great power through the rise of the internet. Turns out weblinks are symbolically much like bridges.
* well loved toys are often given life, but they almost always de-animate as the child grows up. They cannot act in front of all but the very youngest of children.
* the island of lost toys is a real place. The toys there are not only sustained the lingering belief of thier child, but also the longing of all people for precious things lost.

* there are a few groups with the goal of breaking past the 'Law of Normalcy' by awakening enough humans into true belief of the supernatural. It is their belief that this law didn't always exist and is perhaps quite a bit newer than you would think. This is considered a radical idea by the average supernatural. For some reason they never seem to get very far with their plans, even locally.
* The reality bending part of the setting is inspired by the World of Darkness game, Mage: the Ascension.
* Animated children's television show characters are often real and quite powerful. A lot of them work in hollywood. For some reason live action characters rarely become real.

* 'Santa Claus' is title inherited by an awakened human. ([The Santa Clause 1994](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111070/))
