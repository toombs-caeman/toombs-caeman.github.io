# setting the stage
if you're lucky enough to have your own space to play in, invest in some candles or other props to set the mood

# chits
You can always right down a number to track XP and pips, but the extra physicality of having physical markers is nice.

I like using old public transit coins to hand out as XP counters. You can buy an assorted set of them on ebay for pretty cheap.

Timers for abilities are usually kept using a bag of extra d6s. Tracks are only used for long term stuff which sticks around for a while.

You can use different colors of glass stones for enemies, to mark treasures or other points of interests on your map.

# custom dice
You can buy a bag of blank dice for very cheap on Amazon.
I use a wet erase marker to test out custom markings.

Once I'm happy with it, I'll go over the marker with an engraving pen / dremel to make a groove.
You can fill the groove with craft paint and wipe the die face over a sheet of paper on a flat surface to get a crisp edge.

# ai image generation
I use [krita ai diffusion](https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion) to create quick environmental backdrops and character art.
1. generate image from base prompt at 100% strength
2. lightly edit AI glitches. Don't worry about fine details, just get the large shapes and color blocks right.
3. regenerate image with the same prompt at ~80% strength

4. chuck all the images in a google slides presentation
5. give a title to each slide so that they can be jumped to easily from the presenter view
6. you can use presenter notes for room descriptions, etc. They can't be edited live though. I use a physical notebook instead.

# soundboard
this just loads youtube videos in the background and plays the audio.

# scene card
Write SCENE on an index card that you can show to the players when they should end a scene, either because it's dragging or because there's nothing left to find there.
