# premise, tone, aesthetic
# settings and genre specific hacks

Here I'll list rpg settings, works of fiction, historical settings, etc. which I think could be interesting for a campaign.
I'm not happy with the surface level classification of settings into fantasy, scifi, steampunk etc. because while aesthetics is important, loads of different stories can be told using any one of those aesthetics (though some pairings are obviously more common).

After getting a rough list here I want to separate aesthetic from the story/character archetypes taken on by the players.

In a world that lends itself to one aesthetic, can we make 5 or so different types of campaigns?
For example the world of darkness features vampires, hunters, mages, changelings, etc. all with different feels to the campaign but in the same world.

# settings, premise
present 3 settings, present 3 types of character groups/storylines within those settings
setting (NYC, forgotten realms, world of darkness)
making settings
* [3x4 rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2X8Zj3WGag)
    * 4 elements each of time (events), place (locations), and culture (what people do)
[microscope actual play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy21YoYlLzQ)
* use random word generators or [random tropes](https://tvtropes.org/)
* "the gygax 75 challenge" as an example
    * "How to set up your dungeons & dragons campaign - and be stuck refereeing it seven days per week until the wee hours of the morning!"

# microscope (timeline filling minigame)
setting generation is a mini-rpg
* world seed: 1 sentence that underpins the setting
* generate a palette: things each player does and doesn't want to see in the game. Breaking the palette is against the rules
* create the bookends: bookend your timeline with two events that bound the play area, could be weeks or eons apart
* create eras: time periods between the bookends and place them along the timeline (names like 'the enlightenment', 'the dark ages', 'rise of the nanobots')
* create events: things which happen. may be placed in eras
* run a few scenes: a 'lens' poses a question, and sets the scene, noting a few characters who are present. Others elect to take on those roles and continue freeform improv until the question is answered.
events, eras, and scenes are all marked as light/dark good/bad  (use symbols ○/● or different color sticky notes)

how to transition game from microscope/BFB to shark?
pick an era/event, pick stats, make characters to do a few sessions, then continue to microscope?

# beak, feather + bone (map filling minigame) (BFP SRD)
players take on the role of various factions vying for power.
choose an impressive location to be the 'center of power'
take turns drawing cards and selecting locations on a map (marking that location w/ your color):
* the suit indicates the general purpose of a location (social, financial, future, past)
* the value indicates the 'power' that the location gives to the faction
* on face cards: create an NPC of another faction that opposes the purpose of this location
    * beak: What is your rival’s reputation?
    * feather: What is your rival’s appearance?
    * bone: What is your rival’s true motivation?

write down three aspects of that location
* beak - what people are saying about this location
* feather - what the location looks like
* bone - what is actually going on inside (literally or not)

the faction with the most 'power' whenever you stop claims the 'center of power'.
Go for any number of rounds, until the map is filled, or until the cards run out.


(rumors, appearance, interior) [BFB SRD](https://possible-worlds-games.itch.io/bfb-srd)
city layout types? (sandbox generator?)
# examples
Take the world of Dune. You're party could be:
* advisors to a house, vying for power internally while still advancing the goals of the house
* fremen, leading the resistance against the harkonnens
* a sardaukar suicide squad
* scions of allied houses, coming together for a larger political play
* members of the spacing guild

but that world doesn't lend much to the story of a scrappy crew of scoundrels, the way Duskvol from Blades in the Dark does.

On the other hand, take the premise of the scrappy crew of scoundrels hanging around the edges:
* in steampunk setting thats Blades in the Dark
* in scifi it's Firefly
* in high fantasy it's a DnD party full of rogues
* in a historical setting it's pirates

# wild settings (primalpunk?)
* mausritter, household
* blood & snow
* belly of the beast
* wildsea
* horizon zero dawn
* degenesis

# scifi settings
* diamond age - neovictorian nanopunks in a world fractured into many cultures
* dune imperium - cutthroat feudal politics in space
* firefly - scrappy space cowboys
* blade runner - the nature of humanity in a grim technoir future
* war of the worlds
* mecha - giant robots. fuck yeah (lancer?)

# confluence / magitech
* TVA - protectors of the timeline/multiverse
* warp shell - space whale ships mix with magic and technology
* gate - a portal to a world of magic opens in modern day detroit
* shadowrun - gritty urban magitech

# survival/horror
* suicide squad / viking death squad
* crash on a desert island
* zombie apocalypse
* the 100 - different human clans reunite on earth after 1000 year refuge from nuclear radiation
* alien vs predator

# military
tbh the system won't have enough crunch for real intense historical accuracy.
* pentagon politics - play as the politicians and commanders rather than soldiers
* roman legionaires - lost beyond hadrians wall perhaps
* pirates at tortuga / port royal - arr matey

# cosmic horror
* there is no antimemetics division
* anything cthulhu related
* i have no mouth and i must scream

# urban fantasy
* dresden files
* mistborn
* vampire the masquerade
* office workers for a magitech company - scrolls inc. (the office + 80s tech optimism but for magic + cosmic horror?)
* isekai shokudan - running a chill restaurant for odd non-human patrons

# superhero
* teen titans
* the boys

# high fantasy
* forgotten realms
* mage the ascension

# option: stats
You need to decide which stats are relevant for your game. Here are some.
* STR: Brawn, prowess & resistance. might
* DEX: Dodging, sneaking & reflexes. speed
* WIL: Persuasion, intimidation & magic. intellect
* LUX: Money, wealth & resources. wealth
* SANITY: grounding in reality
* STRESS: ability to chill, handle aggrevation

For each stat you use you should know:
* What kind of skills use this stat?
* What kind of conflict hits against this stat? It may or may not be the same as the skills that use it.
* what kind of consequences exist for this stat?
* How does this stat recover?

Keep in mind that having more stats means spreading XP around and slower overall progression.

# option: ghosts and automatons
The dead cannot lie, and do not grow or learn.
A character that dies may persist as a ghost or undead.
They lose the skill 'Do anything', so they may only act as they did in life.
They lose all XP and cannot not gain any more.

Automatons similarly may exhibit complex behaviors (skills), but do not act outside their programming, so do not have 'Do Anything'.
# magic systems
[hard/soft,diverse/unified magic systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oelOVHL9awQ)

mechanics (player understanding) and metaphysics (character understanding)

is 'wizardry' an academic practice that requires extensive study, a profession on its own, or is it incorporated in whatever lifestyle and job. related to how pervasive and diverse it is.

methods of obtaining magic
* emotion - stong emotions elicit a response by magical forces, or those forces are inherently emotive
* vision - having a strong ambition, vision, or drive inherently enables magic (genshin impact)
* inborn - being born with a genetic predisposition (probably recessive) or a magical race
* bestowal - a supernatural being bestows, gifts, or gives in contract magic to an otherwise non-magical being
* material - magic is controlled or obtained through a substance which governs the level of power that can be channeled, but not the form that the magic takes (otherwise it would just be science).
    * consumption - the material is a fuel, either burned or ingested
    * conduit - the material is a catalyst
* cultural
    * language - words or other symbols of power that shape the world. the primary limitation is knowledge, rather than some other method of power limiting.
    * ancestral - knowledge of, and ritual reverence to the ancestry
* epistemology - your view (or a subcultures collective view) of reality warps reality to fit their expectation/faith
    * fame - receiving the faith/expectation of others empowers you magically
    * gratitude - receiving gratitude of others empowers you magically
    * artistry - that which is beautiful has power, so the creation of art is a kind of spellcasting.
* symbiotic - the magic comes from a symbiosis or exposure to environmental toxin
* sacrifice - giving up the flesh, lifeforce, memories, or other intangible bits of the self to obtain or channel power.
    * tattoo based
* celestial - linked to the movement of the stars


narrative problems with elemental magic:
* cliche personality pairings
* cliche weakness/resistance pairings
* cliche 4 elements (platonic) - what about the periodic table? eastern elementalism. is darkness an element? MtG.

narrative problems with magic:
* all wizards are professional wizards


* blood magic
    * what happens when a mage runs out of their normal casting resources? Are they reduced to picking up a sharp stick for defense?
    * I think it's cooler if the mage can also cast using their HP when things get really desperate, but maybe this is an ability restricted to a specific class.

animism - spirit contracting? or simply making offerings to a spirit
In a [vancian magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic) system the mage must prepare spells ahead of time, and 'forgets' the spells they know after use. d&d uses a derivative of this.

# biomes, landmark structures, planets
* biome generation?

    * how does biome affect the generation of landmarks, monsters in that area?
    * is there mechanical effects? affect speed of crossing/resource use.
* planets - if your planet only has one or two real points of interest, just make a single biome planet like star wars
