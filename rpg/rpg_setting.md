# What's a setting?
what makes a place feel real? How real does it need to be to make for a compelling game?

lets break down 'settings' into their constituent parts:
* premise - who are the player characters, what's their archetype and what situation are they in.
    * Is the story about the characters' personal lives, their city, their country, or the fate of their entire world?
* aesthetic - steampunk, high fantasy, scifi, etc.
* tone - grimdark, comedy, epic heroes, scooby doo mystery, etc.
* narrative scopes - does the story take place over the course of a few weeks, a few years, a lifetime? Does the story track a family over 50 generations? 
    * day, year, lifetime, factions, world

My hypothesis is that these components are independent, and can be effectively mixed to generate settings tailored for the kind of play that the group wants.

aesthetic + tone shapes world building. Any world can support most premises, but premises which highlight the aesthetic may be limited.
premise + narrative scope affects the choice of rule subsystems to care about.


Want to make a band of stalwart heroes, galavanting around a classical fantasy setting?
Want to play a group of porch pirates who get in over their head?
Want to do intersteller pizza deliveries full of hijinks?

# cultures
(RPG mainframe)
4 bullets
* greeting - this is key to setting the tone of the dialog, even if you don't do voices, or continue in dialect.
* trigger custom - what do they expect outsiders to do to show respect / understanding (or not do)
* core values - what do they care about
* visual cue - what identifies the in-group

* where in the world is the culture
* the rest can be fleshed out with improv
