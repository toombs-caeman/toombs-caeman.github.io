<h1>Table Top Role-PLaying Games</h1><p>
Some thoughts on ttrpgs. Some I've played, some I've read and some I'd like to, in no particular order.
</li></ul><p>
<h1>: First Time GM/DM</h1><p>
I was pretty nervous, and I made a lot of mistakes being unfamiliar with the mechanics.
The story was pretty highly scripted, and light on the worldbuilding and roleplay aspects.
You could say it was pretty rough, but I had fun and I think the players did too.
There was a second session.
<p>
<ul>
<li>I started with an escape sequence, so that the session starts with a very clear objective, and a limited path forward. When they got out, I let them set a destination to let them have some choice, but ended the session there (so I could prep the next area). I see this as like the first escape mission in Skyrim. It's a linear tutorial before an open world adventure.
</li>
<li>I made sure that the first encounter was could easily be scaled in difficulty on the fly, since I wasn't sure of how much the party could handle.
</li></ul><p>
The ICRPG system is pretty straightforward to GM.
<p>
<h1>Index Card RPG (icrpg)</h1><p>
A simple and stylish d20 game. I also want to try Viking Death Squad, forged by the same hammer.

<h1>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (dnd)</h1><p>
I've read the books, but only ever played a single terrible session in high school.
Dimension 20 is a cool show.
<p>
<h1>Blades in the Dark</h1><p>
Hopefully running a campaign for this eventually.
I love the dark victorian-punk style.
<p>
<h1>Roll for Shoes</h1><p>
The idea of this just set my brain on fire.
It has the simplicity of something truly classic, but I have yet to run it to prove how well it does.
<p>
<a href="gamedeck.md#Roll-for-Shoes">: mini rules</a>
<p>
Shoes in the Dark is a variant that shows promise as well.
<p>
<h1>Modular RPG System</h1><p>
Is there a 'meta-rpg' that allows integrating the mechanics to support all of these, but which deftly elides whatever the players aren't interested in at the moment?
<p>
Things like Roll for Shoes or Risus are really cool, but lend themselves to a specific genre of play (comedy more than dramatic or gritty campaigns).
I want a system that can gracefully transition from rules-lite to crunchy depending on which optional rules are used.
<p>
spectra of rules
<ul>
<li>gritty to epic - how deadly is combat? do you count bullets?
</li>
<li>chance to skill - rolling d20 has a wide spread of chance, while with 3d6 the average value is more typical
</li>
<li>light to heavy - how many numbers go on the character sheet?
</li>
<li>mechanical to roleplay-based - do you reward role playing mechanically? Is it more board game or improv?
</li>
<li>embedded vs universal - how heavily themed are your mechanics? honey heist vs GURPs
</li></ul><p>
I'm <a href="shark_rpg.html">attempting</a> to throw this together (and I'm ready for the heartbreak).
