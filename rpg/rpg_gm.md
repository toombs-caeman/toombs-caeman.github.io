(gumshoe) in a situation where the PCs are in no position to affect the outcome, simply decree that it happens. Don’t bother testing an NPCs ability. To do otherwise is to engage in false branching: you are creating unpredictability for yourself in a way that remains invisible to the players. They don’t get a chance to alter the outcome, and thus gain no benefit from the uncertainty you’ve introduced.

You should always understand the players intention when they get into a situation. Are they starting a fight? What do they hope the outcome to be? You should know. Ask them.
