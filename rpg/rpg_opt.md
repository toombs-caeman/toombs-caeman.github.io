# Rules and Domains
This game is about narratives, stories told and made together around a table. The rules are incidental and should get out of the way as much as possible, but rules *are* useful to keep the story on track.

A focused narrative is usually only "about" a few things. Each "thing" here is a key domain, about which there should probably be rules. The rules detailing each of these domains should be clear and detailed to keep the story "realistic" and to enable nuanced play. This is why the core rules mostly relate to player characters; these stories are "about" the player characters.

Rules for other, less important domains should be simplified as much as possible to keep focus, narratively and mechanically, on the key domains. However, these neglected domains still need to be balanced enough to prevent the story from becoming about them.
For example, if your story isn't about money, it doesn't make sense to track every dollar, different currencies, property tax, and inflation. It may be enough to say that a character is "wealthy" or "poor". However, if your characters are regularly using wealth to solve problems, then your story is about money. You'll probably need more detailed rules to give a little nuance or to focus solutions away from "just throw money at it".

If a domain doesn't come up in the game, the rules that apply to it don't matter. Obviously don't bother introducing rules that won't come up in play. Keep the rules as simple as possible, but no simpler.

## Ludonarrative Dissonance
If the rules as given run counter to the overall shape and tone of the narrative then they are worse than useless. The rules are in service of the narrative, not the other way around.

This does not mean letting the players do whatever they want. Rules that fit the tone can and often will result in the players suffering. The rule is only dissonant if its in-world effects are consistently not "what the players signed up for", or if the rule encourages a tonally disruptive play-style.

Agree to the narrative tone of the game ahead of time (session 0), and tailor the rules to match that tone.

## Choosing Optional Rules
From the previous ranting, we can get an idea for when to use rules beyond the core rules.
The remainder of this section is a collection of rules which may or may not apply to your game.
categories:
* domain - what does the ruleset cover? There may be multiple rules for the same domain here, for different narrative contexts.
* complexity - how much detail does the ruleset capture? Simpler rules are usually prefered unless the domain is very important for your game.
* genre - does this ruleset impart a specific feeling or tone to the game?


# Optional Rules
# : Stats
Stats are an associated resource which fluctuates between a characters 'stat level' at maximum and zero.

The stats you use make a big statement about the tone and direction of your game.
In a sense, stats represent the ways in which characters will be tested (pushing rolls and offsetting hits), and the ways in which they may be broken down (taking on consequences).

Characters with a 'strength' stat may regularly need to break things, and may find themselves in a situation where their strength fails them.
Characters with a 'sanity' stat will see some shit, and there's always a chance they go mad.
These things can of course still happen if you don't use strength or sanity stats, but doing so creates an implicit agreement at the table that these things will come up, and gives the players a degree of mechanical control over how and when.

Here are some possible stats:
* STR: Brawn, prowess & resistance. might
* DEX: Dodging, sneaking & reflexes. speed
* CON: Resisting, health & physical recovery
* INT: Education, erudition & nerd shit
* WIS: Insight, connection to nature & crunchy granola
* CHA: Rizz, seduction, grace, social intuition
* WIL: Persuasion, intimidation & magic. intellect
* LUX: Money, wealth & resources.
* SANITY: grounding in reality, ability to handle stress or otherworldly knowledge
* MAGIC: many settings tie magical ability to intelligence or wisdom, but it doesn't have to be.

For each stat you use you should know:
* What kind of skills use this stat?
* What kind of conflict hits against this stat?
* What kind of consequences exist for this stat?
* How does this stat recover?
* In what situations does the use of this stat overlap with another?

Using two to six stats is pretty normal.
Using more stats makes the game crunchier, and slows progress somewhat as XP is spread around.
Using very few stats can leave players without a lot of pips, or limit character build options.

# procedural genre (cop shows, csi) (gumshoe system)
GUMSHOE speeds and streamlines the time-honored form of the investigative roleplaying
game. The central question a traditional RPG asks is:
Will the heroes get the information they need?
Assuming that they look in the right place and apply appropriate abilities to the task,
GUMSHOE ensures that the heroes get the basic clues they need to move through the story. The
question it asks is:
What will the heroes do with the information once they’ve got it?
If you think about it, this is how the source materials we base our mystery scenarios on handle
lues. You don’t see the forensic techies on CSI failing to successfully use their lab equipment, or
Sherlock Holmes stymied and unable to move forward because he blew his Zoology roll.
You don’t see this because, in a story failure to gain information is rarely more interesting than
getting it. New information opens up new narrative possibilities, new choices and actions for the
characters. Failure to get information is a null result that takes you nowhere.
In a fictional procedural, whether it’s a mystery novel or an episode of a cop show, the
emphasis isn’t on finding the clues in the first place. When it really matters, you may get a
paragraph telling you how difficult the search was, or a montage of a CSI team tossing an
apartment. But the action really starts after the clues are gathered.
Investigative scenarios are not about finding clues, they’re about interpreting the clues you do
find.
GUMSHOE, therefore, makes the finding of clues all but automatic, as long as you get to the
right place in the story and have the right ability. That’s when the fun part begins, when the
players try to put the components of the puzzle together.


Every investigative scenario begins with a crime, conspiracy, or other act of disorder
committed by a group of antagonists. The bad guys do something bad. The player characters
must figure out who did it and put a stop to their activities.
Your GM designs each scenario by creating an investigation trigger, a sinister conspiracy, and a
trail of clues.
The investigation trigger. This is the event, that attracts the attention of investigators.
• The discovery of a murder victim, obviously slain during a ritualistic killing.
• The discovery of a corpse slain by supernatural means, perhaps by a creature.
• Sightings of supernatural creatures or phenomena.
The sinister conspiracy. This sets out who the bad guys are, what they’ve done so far, what
they’re trying to do, and how the investigation trigger fits into the overall scheme. The GM also
determines what has to happen to prevent the plot from going forward. This, unknown to the
players, is their victory condition — what they have to do to thwart the bad guys and bring the
story to a positive conclusion.
GM prepares
* trail of clues
* series of antagonist reactions (curse of strahd)

whew - a little refresh to mental stats when players are anxious about a situation which turns out to be nothing

core insights
* players should never fail to find a necessary clue. The story is about *how* they deal with the unfolding mystery, not *if* they can manage to piece it together. A high investigation check could provide extra flavor, or a more direct path, but rolling low shouldn't bring the narrative to a halt.
* create at least three clues that may lead to every core conclusion (three clue rule). Pacing of the story is controlled by how quickly the players assemble the necessary information, not how fast they run through each lead.

# tactical combat (XCOM, D&D)
* cover: exposed, partial cover, full cover
* square or hex grids, movement speeds, weapon reach, weapon/damage types, armor
* reloading and running out of ammo
* called shots, higher target in order to hit specific part and get an aspect related to specific damage

# strategic / logistic combat (war gaming)
* square or hex grids, movement speeds, weapon reach, weapon/damage types, armor
* how to model platoon vs platoon rather than soldier vs soldier combat (combat across scales?)
* supply lines
* weather, terrain
* morale of soldiers, support from the people. At what point does an enemy rout, rather than fighting to the death?

# : Magic
from a mechanics standpoint, perhaps a classification of scope (time+space+impact) x effect to calculate cost?
In fatigue magic systems is mentally straining to cast and uses up some resource (usually called mana). Using up all available mana sometimes results in being incapacitated.
Under this system, mages have an MP stat which is consumed and regenerated like HP, but all spells the mage knows are available at all times (as long as their mana doesn't run out)
Alternatively, 'Fatigue' could take up an inventory slot, and require the mage to either spend an action to drop fatigue, creating a tradeoff between loot, armor and magic. The spell itself may also take up inventory in the form of a spell book. This system creates a reason for mages to avoid dumping their constitution stat, if constitution impacts the carry limit.
(I think I saw this in some GLOG related post)

# option: inventory
Do you track every arrow and every coin?
potential inventory systems:
* you have everything the character reasonably would have
* you can carry X items.
* you can carry X items, but everyday items aren't counted.
* the amount you can carry is tied to a stat level (STR, CON, etc.)

# option: money
potential money systems:
* you can buy anything the character reasonably could buy
* you have a bank account (currency has no carry weight, generally can't be lost)
* you carry a coin purse (currency has a weight limit, a grey ooze will eat it).
* use a LUX stat to represent wealth.
    * Each LUX pip has some nominal value.
    * Generate pips equal to your level every week.
    * You may stack pips higher than your level.

# market economics
Do the players buy, trade, and sell "stuff"?
Can they flood the economy, or only sell stuff in certain locations? How volitile is price and how much can they haggle?
In the past logistic limitations were a major factor in price, though less so now at least for most consumer items.
Tarrifs, availability, margins&middlemen.

## renting
let players rent buildings and vehicles at 0.1% per day 1% the value per month or 10% per year (round up).
players should likewise be able to rent out spaces to receive the same back.

The a 1 chunk carriage will cost 1 coin per day, 3 per month, and 25 per year to rent, or 250 coins to buy.
A 5 room house will cost 2 coins per night, 13 per month, 125 per year, or 1250 to buy.

## crafting economy
Can the players make "stuff" to sell? How does the economy of buying materials and selling stuff incentivize play?
How do you model the time it takes to craft?
"size x complexity -> time" table, material rarity -> effect strength
How do you manage pacing at the table, if one player is interested in spending weeks crafting an item. What do the other characters do in that time?
Crafting, unless it is the main focus of your game, should be less profitable than adventuring.
Diagetically, adventuring is more dangerous, and adventurers need to be compensated for that risk or why bother.
From a GMing perspective it can also be hard to pace the game when one player is off crafting for long periods of in-world time.

cooking only makes sense if food quality has narrative impact

## gathering/looting, appraisal
what related skills are there?
How do players gather materials for crafting, or know what it is that they've found.
Does it require a skill check to butcher a monster, but not to loot a humanoid for items their holding?

## crafting trees, enchanting
consider how magic items are made, are the mundane versions of the item an ingredient?
How many steps does it take to make an item on average, sequences of rolls affect overall probability


# option: vehicles, buildings, mech suits
How do you handle large modular assets that players may own?
(ICRPG chunks)
In ICRPG, vehicles and the like are represented mechanically as a set of chunks.
Each "chunk" has 10 HP and 1 special ability, weighs 250lbs, and costs 250 COINs.
This allows chunks to be individually destroyed or repaired (impairing the related function when broken)
as well as providing a basic and consistent price for a huge range of property types.

a motorcycle is a 1 chunk vehicle and can comfortably fit one rider, or two riders that squeeze.
A 2 chunk light aircraft can seat 4 people, including the pilot.

Mech units generally fit only the pilot, and may be smaller than 250lbs per chunk, but are primarily priced by the number of functions they hold.

For buildings, 1 chunk is 100sqft (a 10x10ft room). Max occupancy is 10 humans per chunk.
A 1 chunk bedroom can house a single person, or two that squeeze.
A 4 chunk great room is 20x20ft and can hold a maximum of 40 (human sized) people.

These are general guidelines. The point is to use round numbers and not overthink things too much.

# companions, pets, and other NPC allies
* how to manage action economy?
Companions are passive in combat until asked to do something by a trusted PC. Asking is not an action, but it is a roll. They may act once per round.

# : soak/armor
'Soak' negates a number of hits for every roll against you.
'Armor s1' could be an item that absorbs (negates or soaks up) one hit everytime someone hits you in physical combat.

Soak could be static (always soaks the same amount) or dynamic (roll, every hit absorbs one hit).
Keep in mind that static soak is twice as effective on average compared to dynamic soak, and faster at the table.
(mini d6)

This can also be handled as cuts. 'Armor 1c' would cut against someone rolling physical damage against you.

# organizations, factions, legacy, countries, clans, guilds
destruction of an army, not by natural means but by the [faults of a general](https://suntzusaid.com/book/10/14)
BitD factions
factions get a character sheet just like individuals (fractal description)
curse of strahd escalation tree

## organizations over time
* "wealth does not last beyond three generations"
* institutions become more corrupt as they age

## social stability/collapse
* create a track or clock that's "minutes to midnight" for some cataclysmic event
    * for a larger society, roll random encounters that occur away from the party. These affect the track.
* fall of the roman empire took 200 years, didn't look like collapse from the inside
* cia social disruption tactics/guerilla tactics?

# character creation
* dungeon crawl classic level 0 funnel
* traveller life simulation
* dnd class + race + bonds/ideals/flaws
[:intra party relationships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UQs9CCHlb0)

(fate core character creation)

# traps
* [grimtooth's traps](https://annarchive.com/files/Grimtooth's%20Traps.pdf)
    * click rule
    * I'm not a huge fan of the traps presented here (as presented) since they represent a much more adversarial relationship between players and GM, and often cause meaningless death. The traps seem to have little connection to the purpose of the dungeon, and are 'gotchas' that invalidate any deep design or roleplay that the players put into their characters. They might work well in a campaign where characters are essentially disposable cannon fodder, but that type of play doesn't appeal to me. If it did I would still find these to be more rube goldburg than horrifying.

# powerscaling
* how to handle conflict at vastly different scale? fractality?
    * human vs colossus/vehicle
    * human vs ant (swarm?)
    * human -> guild -> country

# Horror, Cosmic Horror, Body Horror
* disempowerment
* fear (characters fear, not necessarily the players fear)

# Romance
represent romantic interest with an NPC as a track.

# Apocalypse & Cataclysm: The Disaster genre
every good disaster movie:
* starts with a scientist/whistleblower telling the president/CEO that something desperately needs to be addressed but they are ignored.
* rising action: problems mount and are swept under the rug or go unnoticed.
* climax: massive casualties or other loss
* falling action: cathartic destruction/undermining of the inflexible authority figure, survivors regroup and rebuild

"The Disaster" should have a dedicated track/timer which the players can influence, maybe playing into the discovery/mystery aspect of being unsure how their actions affect the track. There is also a certain helplessness to prevent the inevitable.
The during the climax, play turns toward hardcore survival, though there may or may not be real danger there.

The Disaster genre serves best as a one-shot since characters may not have a structurally compelling reason to continue their adventuring after The Disaster, unless the game transitions to the post-apocalyptic type.

Players should feel compelled to push hard to rage against the dying of the light, and yet know that ultimately they are doomed. It's tricky to balance on this edge of dispair. Push it too far and players give up, but be too lenient and they won't feel the tension that the characters feel. Player actions should have an impact on how things go down, even if things ultimately *will* go down in flames.


# death and dismemberment
wildsea: "you'll never die before you're ready. Death is a narrative event, not a mechanical one"

There is no mechanism by which a PC must die or be decommissioned. Consequences stacking up can make it impractical to continue, especially if the setting is such that they are difficult to remove, but it is usually on the player to decide how and when their character exits the story.
If character death or permanent alteration is possible through consequences, this should be communicated in session 0.


# : Mystery
the three clue rule (not a rule, but advice really)

# : Epic Heroes
* D&D
* heroes may fall in combat often, but they have a few chances to get back up
* injury is often abstract and easily healed in a generic way.
* heroes may come to be many times more powerful than typical for their species. The powerscaling can get weird

# : Absurdist Comedy
risus: a hairdresser is deadly in combat
If you use a totally inappropriate skill for a task, the GM notes it and gives you a few extra cuts.
If you still manage to succeed, then you get an absurdity boost, a few extra hits.
This means doing things the wrong way can be pretty effective, good for encouraging comedy.

Impro status: comedy is when we are absolved of the need for empathy towards one, and misfortune befalls them.
Comedic characters cannot have gravitas unless it is undermined.

# : Survival genre: hunger/thirst stats
take a hit against a hunger stat every day. re-gain 1 pip per meal.
the max level for hunger is alway 6.
rather than taking consequences when hunger is 0:
* lose 1 die on all rolls
* take a hit against health every day
* you don't regain health while resting.
