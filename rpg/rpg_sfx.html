<h1>setting the stage</h1><p>
if you're lucky enough to have your own space to play in, invest in some candles or other props to set the mood
<p>
<h1>chits</h1><p>
You can always right down a number to track XP and pips, but the extra physicality of having physical markers is nice.
<p>
I like using old public transit coins to hand out as XP counters. You can buy an assorted set of them on ebay for pretty cheap.
<p>
Timers for abilities are usually kept using a bag of extra d6s. Tracks are only used for long term stuff which sticks around for a while.
<p>
You can use different colors of glass stones for enemies, to mark treasures or other points of interests on your map.
<p>

<h1>custom dice</h1><p>
You can buy a bag of blank dice for very cheap on Amazon.
I use a wet erase marker to test out custom markings.
<p>
Once I'm happy with it, I'll go over the marker with an engraving pen / dremel to make a groove.
You can fill the groove with craft paint and wipe the die face over a sheet of paper on a flat surface to get a crisp edge.

<h1>ai image generation</h1><p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion">krita ai diffusion</a> to create quick environmental backdrops and character art.
<ol>
<li>generate image from base prompt at 100% strength
</li>
<li>lightly edit AI glitches. Don't worry about fine details, just get the large shapes and color blocks right.
</li>
<li>regenerate image with the same prompt at ~80% strength
</li></ol><p>
<ol>
<li>chuck all the images in a google slides presentation
</li>
<li>give a title to each slide so that they can be jumped to easily from the presenter view
</li>
<li>you can use presenter notes for room descriptions, etc. They can't be edited live though. I use a physical notebook instead.

this just loads youtube videos in the background and plays the audio.

<h1>printable minis</h1><p>

This is not something I really do, but it could be fun.

<h1>scene card</h1><p>
Write SCENE on an index card that you can show to the players when they should end a scene, either because it's dragging or because there's nothing left to find there.
