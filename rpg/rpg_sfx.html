<h1>setting the stage</h1><p>
if you're lucky enough to have your own space to play in, invest in some candles or other props to set the mood
<p>
<h1>chits</h1><p>
You can always right down a number to track XP and pips, but the extra physicality of having physical markers is nice.
<p>
I like using old public transit coins to hand out as XP counters. You can buy an assorted set of them on ebay for pretty cheap.
<p>
Timers for abilities are usually kept using a bag of extra d6s. Tracks are only used for long term stuff which sticks around for a while.
<p>
You can use different colors of glass stones for enemies, to mark treasures or other points of interests on your map.

<h1>custom dice</h1><p>
You can buy a bag of blank dice for very cheap on Amazon.
I use a wet erase marker to test out custom markings.
<p>
Once I'm happy with it, I'll go over the marker with an engraving pen / dremel to make a groove.
You can fill the groove with craft paint and wipe the die face over a sheet of paper on a flat surface to get a crisp edge.

<h1>ai image generation</h1><p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion">krita ai diffusion</a> to create quick environmental backdrops and character art.

<h1>scene card</h1><p>
Write SCENE on an index card that you can show to the players when they should end a scene, either because it's dragging or because there's nothing left to find there.
