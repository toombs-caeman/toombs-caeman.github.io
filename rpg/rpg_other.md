# Table Top Role-PLaying Games
Some thoughts on ttrpgs. Some I've played, some I've read and some I'd like to, in no particular order.

# : First Time GM/DM
I was pretty nervous, and I made a lot of mistakes being unfamiliar with the mechanics.
The story was pretty highly scripted, and light on the worldbuilding and roleplay aspects.
You could say it was pretty rough, but I had fun and I think the players did too.
There was a second session.

* I started with an escape sequence, so that the session starts with a very clear objective, and a limited path forward. When they got out, I let them set a destination to let them have some choice, but ended the session there (so I could prep the next area). I see this as like the first escape mission in Skyrim. It's a linear tutorial before an open world adventure.
* I made sure that the first encounter was could easily be scaled in difficulty on the fly, since I wasn't sure of how much the party could handle.

The ICRPG system is pretty straightforward to GM.

# Index Card RPG (icrpg)
A simple and stylish d20 game. I also want to try Viking Death Squad, forged by the same hammer.

# Dungeons & Dragons (dnd)
I've read the books, but only ever played a single terrible session in high school.
Dimension 20 is a cool show.

# Blades in the Dark
Hopefully running a campaign for this eventually.
I love the dark victorian-punk style.

# Roll for Shoes
The idea of this just set my brain on fire.
It has the simplicity of something truly classic, but I have yet to run it to prove how well it does.

[: mini rules](gamedeck.md#Roll-for-Shoes)

Shoes in the Dark is a variant that shows promise as well.

# Modular RPG System
Is there a 'meta-rpg' that allows integrating the mechanics to support all of these, but which deftly elides whatever the players aren't interested in at the moment?

Things like Roll for Shoes or Risus are really cool, but lend themselves to a specific genre of play (comedy more than dramatic or gritty campaigns).
I want a system that can gracefully transition from rules-lite to crunchy depending on which optional rules are used.

spectra of rules
* gritty to epic - how deadly is combat? do you count bullets?
* chance to skill - rolling d20 has a wide spread of chance, while with 3d6 the average value is more typical
* light to heavy - how many numbers go on the character sheet?
* mechanical to roleplay-based - do you reward role playing mechanically? Is it more board game or improv?
* embedded vs universal - how heavily themed are your mechanics? honey heist vs GURPs

I'm [attempting](shark_rpg.md) to throw this together (and I'm ready for the heartbreak).
