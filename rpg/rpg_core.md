# What makes a Character
characters are:
* stats (pip resevoir) - areas in which characters will be tested, they can push themselves to succeed, and sometimes fail
* skills (proficiency tags) - things that the character is good at doing
* schemes (plot tags) - character motivations, ambitions, arcs

characters have:
* inventory (stuff tags)
* conditions (status tags)
* XP (resevoir)

# Tags
Tags are a descriptive phrase (name) and a number (level), attached to a thing in the game world (target).
The name describes some aspect of the target, and the level describes how impactful the tag can be.

Skills are tags. Consequences are tags. Room descriptions are tags.
If there is an X in the room near you, this is implicitly a tag "X 1"
Using that X to your benefit grants 1 extra die, but if it being there makes things harder for you it cuts against you.

Tags may grant bonus dice, or cut against you whenever appropriate. The same tag may be both good and bad.

# Tracks
Tracks are used to 'track' progress over time.
Each track has a name describing what its for, a way to make, lose, and represent that progress, and something that happens at the end.

For example: "Time until the sun explodes 2" is a number on an index card that decreases every session. If the number hits zero, the sun explodes. The players may or may not have a way to delay or stop this timer.

Many tracks are timers, which naturally progress over time. This time can be in-world time, real time, or a number of rounds or turns. Player actions can often quicken, delay, or stop timers. 
Other tracks only advance when the players interact with them.

Keep timers out in the open in order to drive suspense. Only sometimes tell the players what it's for.

## simple tracks
With simple tracks, progress is just a number.
This can be represented by a written number, a countdown die, or "Blades in the Dark"-style clocks.

For numbers and dice, I recommend counting down, with something happening at zero.

Dice are most useful for quick and dirty timers up to about 6 or 8 ticks. They are also useful when you need a timer of random length. However, written tracks are less prone to getting knocked over or forgotten.

A "clock" is a circle, divided with lines into pie wedges. Each wedge is colored in as progress is made, and something happens when the circle is full. This creates a nice visual representation of how long a task will take, without being yet another number on the table.

## complex tracks (wildsea)
More complex tracks can be represented with "Wildsea"-style tracks.

The track is a series of steps with each step being represented by a circle (○○○○).
Steps are ticked (with a slash ∅) when they are completed.
Steps may be burned (with an X ⦻) to represent that a completed step is particularly hard to undo.
The track may contain breaks (a line between steps ○|○○) to represent milestones that happen along the way.

example: "build a castle ∅○○○|○○" Six steps are needed to complete this track, and the first is already done. After the first four steps something will happen. Perhaps the break is when the outer walls is complete, but the interior still needs two ticks to complete.

Progress is removed from a track by erasing ticks. If you anticipate this happening often, you may want to draw the circles with pen, and mark progress with pencil.

## track examples
* "room on fire 4"
    * at the end of 4 rounds, the room collapses
    * if players use a fire extinguisher, the timer can go up by one or two.
* "instability in the kingdom ○○○○○|○○"
    * at the break the king goes missing and if it progresses to the end there's a total collapse.
    * players can strongly influence this by pacifying the commoners and addressing problems to remove and slow progress.
    * burn may occur when a particularly influental or popular noble gets very publically murdered.
    * perhaps there's a conspiracy behind the whole thing, and the track can be removed by discovering it.
* "build a castle ○○○○|○○|○○"
    * progresses every month, as long as the workers are being paid. Can be sped up by hiring more workers.
    * the outer wall is built by the first break, and the moat by the second.
    * a monster attack can set back progress if the outer wall isn't finished yet.
* "decode the password 4 rounds"
    * Timers can be used to indicate that an action doesn't need any more rolls to succeed, but will take some time.
    * you won't have to roll repeatedly.

# Resevoir
A resevoir represent a kind of fungible resource for which there is a max amount you can have.
The value of the resevoir is how many of that resource it currently has and its level is the maximum number it can have.

Like tracks there are a few ways to represent a resevoir, but the simplest is "name X/Y" where X is the current value, and Y is the level.

# Characters
Characters are mechanically defined by their skills (things they do well) and their stats (reserves of strength which characters may draw on to avoid serious consequences or to push themselves to succeed).
Skills grow as they are used.
Practice makes perfect and failure is the mother of success, but things go too wrong characters will experience the consequences of their failures.

# The Core: skills, rolling, XP
Every characters starts with the skill: "Do Anything 1"

Use a skill to act by rolling a number of d6 equal to your skill level.
Each die that rolls 4 or higher is a 'hit'.
The highest die you roll determines what happens.
Gain 1 XP when you roll no hits.

The GM will give you a target as a number of hits needed to succeed at what you're attempting before asking you to roll.
For some tasks it is possible to make progress over the course of several rolls, but others are all or nothing.

# Stats & stat points
Stats are a reserve of strength which characters may draw on to avoid serious consequences or to push themselves to succeed.
Which stats are tracked varies by setting.

Your character starts with a number of points (SP) in each stat equal to that stats level.

stat points may be spent to modify a roll.
Spend 1 point to raise the value of a rolled die by 1. For example you may spend 2 points to turn a rolled 2 into a 4, causing that die to hit.
Spend 2 points to roll one extra die. You may do this after your initial roll.

If your setting tracks multiple stats, you can only spend points from the most relevant stat for the action you are taking.
Stat points are generally recovered through rest or healing, but may have a more specific method.

# Progression
 “Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.”
― Jake the Dog

Whenever you roll all 6s, or you choose to spend 1 XP for every non-6 rolled, gain a skill related to what you just did at 1 level higher than the skill you rolled.
You can use the XP gained from a failed roll in order to gain a skill from that same roll.

You may spend 1XP to raise a stat's level by 1. You don't immediately gain any points in that stat if you are in a conflict.
The maximum level for any stat is 6 times your highest skill level (maybe unnecessary?).

# Consequences
If another character rolls against you and hits, you must offset each hit by paying 3 points from the most relevant stat.
If you have only 1 or 2 points, pay all points to offset 1 hit.
If you cannot offset a hit then you must take on a consequence decided by the GM or concede.

The level of the consequence is equal to the number of hits it offsets (written here as negative).
You may not have more than one consequence at the same level for the same stat.
New consequences are promoted to the next available level.

While you have consequences, rolls which narratively should affected get 'cut'.
After rolling remove the highest die for each cut.

Example consequences for a health stat (HP, CON, vigour, etc.):
* -1 sprained wrist
* -2 broken arm
* -3 severed arm
* -4 bleeding out

level 4 consequences are fatal, either figuratively or literally.
You may not physically die from a -4 social consequence, but you might be socially dead and have to leave town.

Conceding lets your antagonist get their way, in exchange for avoiding further consequences.
In a life-or-death struggles conceding results in death, but most conflict is of a less extreme nature.

Removing a consequence is done by taking an action with the consequence level as a target, and spending a reasonable amount of time resting. This usually cannot be done during the conflict where the consequence was earned.

## flashbacks
You may spend 2XP to have a flashback in order to meet a useful contact, prepare the perfect tool, or bribe a guard in advance.

What exactly you can do is up to the GMs discretion. However, flashbacks do not allow players to negate any of the established narrative, only to assert something which has not previously been established.
When a player uses a flashback so that Jane the Thief brings a length of rope to the heist, the rope was in her backpack all along. The players are only learning about it now, but for Jane nothing has changed. Flashbacks do not change the past, only reveal it.

# GM intrusions
The GM can offer a you 2XP to introduce a complication to the scene. You may reject that complication by paying 1XP.
This can make a failure worse, or complicate a success, but doesn't negate your roll.

# Character Creation
Choose a name and background.
Every characters starts with the skill "Do Anything 1", 18 XP, and 1 level in every stat.
You must spend all of your XP on skills or stats.
Don't roll for skills as you usually would, but instead spend 1XP per level for all skills.
Skills must still build on one another in the usual way (a level 3 skill is a more specialized version of a level 2 skill you already have).
Finally, gain full pips for all stats

# character creation
* creating character mechanics (initial stats)
* creating character narrative/history
* creating inter-character relationships

example character:
```
Brick - wandering orc chef
5/5 STR
3/3 DEX
1/1 WIL

do anything 1
fight 2, bash 3
cook 2, blazing soup 3
poetry 2
```

# common advantages / disadvantages
* easy 1: you should be able to do what you're attempting, so add 1 die.
* assist +X: X party members with a relevant skill are helping you
* hard -1: your skill isn't a great match, or there are otherwise unaccounted for diffulties
* far -1: ranged attacks lose power/accuracy at distance

# Summary
Rolling:
1. identify what you want to do, the skill you want to use, and advantages and disadvantages
1. roll (skill level + advantages) # of dice
2. spend stat points to modify the roll (1 point: increase die face, 2 point: roll an extra die)
3. optionally gain skills, spending XP if you so choose.
4. cut the highest die for every disadvantage or remove pips from last remaining die
5. the highest die left determines the result (1/2/3: fail, 4/5:minor success, 6:major success)
6. count the number of hits (4/5/6) to determine amount of effort

Gain XP:
* roll no hits: 1XP
* accept an intrusion: 2XP

Spend XP:
* 1XP: increase stat by 1 (up to 6x your highest skill level, gain points only if outside conflict)
* 1XP/non-6: gain a skill
* 2XP: do a flashback
* 1XP: refuse an intrusion

Gain pips through stat specific methods, generally by resting.

Spend stat points:
* 1p: add 1 to a die you rolled
* 2p: add an extra die to your roll
* 3p: offset a hit against you

Character creation:
* choose name and background
* gain 'Do Anything 1' and 1 level in all stats
* spend 18 XP on skills and stats

consequences:
* offset 1 hit per level
* new consequences level up if they share the same level and stat with another.
* recover by rolling against consequence level then resting.

# maybe
* gain xp by keys (rp of character motivations, lady blackbird)?
    * gives mechanical advantage to RP, but less squishy than 'inspiration'
