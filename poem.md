# the spirit of striving
the spirit of striving begins as a seed, strewn into the fertile mind and tended with care.
* invoke the muses

1. introduction - the poem short form
2. how to memorize generally
    * original awareness
    * spaced repetition
2. structuring data to be more memorable
    * mnemonics
    * repeating structures (rhyme, rhythm, refrains) and imagery
    * making the abstract concrete through metaphor
    * memory palace
    * how these are applied to this poem

3. spaced repetition
    * the recital schedule
4. deliberate practice
    * typical failures of "mindful" "repetition"
        * large/excessively difficult experiments slow down repetition
        * rote repetition is not mindful
    * doing small experiments: prediction, variable, review
    * methods of introspection
        * seeking feedback
4. bloom's stages of skill development
    1.
5. goals
    * improving execution ("training")
    * improving conceptualization ("developing insight")
    * seeking a syllabus
    * seeking a coach
    * when is it good enough? when to learn just enough vs learn in depth? 




# deliberate practice
there are failures of conceptualization and failures of execution.
can learners generate ad-hoc drills for focusing on failures of execution, but not those of conceptualization because they do not understand why they have failed.
The field determines the necessary mix of concept and execution.

what appears to be a problem of execution may in fact be a problem of framing. Why is dieting so hard? Everyone knows CICO. "Just eat less" is a solution to an insufficient conceptualization of the domain.

failure of optimality - perceiving behaviour as optimal when it is not
failure of overcorrection - perceiving behavior to be unoptimal, when other aspects have more room for improvement

there’s a mountain of empirical evidence that you can increase the number of examples & problem-solving experiences in a student’s knowledge base,
but a lack of evidence that you can increase the student’s ability to generalize from those examples (by doing things other than equipping them with progressively more advanced examples & problem-solving experiences).
In other words, research indicates the best way to improve your problem-solving ability in any domain is simply by acquiring more foundational skills in that domain.
