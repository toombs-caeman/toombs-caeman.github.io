I was pretty nervous, and I made a lot of mistakes being unfamiliar with the mechanics.
The story was pretty highly scripted, and light on the worldbuilding and roleplay aspects.
You could say it was pretty rough, but I had fun and I think the players did too.
There was a second session.

* I started with an escape sequence, so that the session starts with a very clear objective, and a limited path forward. When they got out, I let them set a destination to let them have some choice, but ended the session there (so I could prep the next area). I see this as like the first escape mission in Skyrim. It's a linear tutorial before an open world adventure.
* I made sure that the first encounter was could easily be scaled in difficulty on the fly, since I wasn't sure of how much the party could handle.

# Modular RPG Systems
things like Roll for Shoes or Risus are really cool, but lend themselves to comedy more than dramatic or gritty campaigns.
I want a system that can gracefully transition from rules-lite to crunchy depending on which system modules

spectra of rules
* gritty to epic - how deadly is combat? do you count bullets?
* chance to skill - rolling d20 has a wide spread of chance, while with 3d6 the average value is more typical
* light to heavy - how many numbers go on the character sheet?
* mechanical to roleplay-based - do you reward role playing mechanically? Is there a 'rule of cool'?
# core system
the core system is [exceedingly simple](https://dozens.itch.io/shoes-in-the-dark)

Characters start with one skill: "Do Anything 1"

Use skills to act by rolling a number of d6 equal to your skill level.
You succeed if your highest die is a 4 or higher.
Gain 1 XP on failure.

When you roll all 6s or choose to spend 1 XP for every non-6 rolled, gain a skill related to what you just did at 1 level higher than the skill you rolled.

roll types
* static target - the GM picks a number of successes 
* opposed roll
* effort - count number of successes

narrative dis/advantage - give Â±1 d6 each
# optional rules
## : criticals
if you roll more than one 6, it's a critical success.
If you roll any 1s and fail, it's a critical failure.

Critical rolls create narrative dis/advantages which affecting the odds of future rolls in addition to the immediate results.
## : damage, stress, sanity
## : advanced character creation
start your characters with 10 levels in skills related to your characters backstory
Either:
* keep to the normal rules for skills (that a level 3 skill must be a specialization of a level 2 skill), so you must spend all 10 points to get a single level 4 skill, or
* allow initial skills to be up to level 3 (but don't require the supporting levels). Let these be more general than normal at that level. This allows something like class specialization, as the character will be more powerful than other people in their initial skill areas. Think of these skills like Risus cliches.
## : health, wealth, reptutation

## : inventory
Do you track every arrow and every coin? 

## magic
### : vancian magic
[vancian magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic)
In this system the mage must prepare spells ahead of time, and 'forgets' the spells they know after use.
d&d uses a derivative of this.
### : fatigue
In this system magic is mentally straining to cast and uses up some resource (usually called mana). Using up all available mana sometimes results in being incapacitated.

Under this system, mages have an MP stat which is consumed and regenerated like HP, but all spells the mage knows are available at all times (as long as their mana doesn't run out)

Alternatively, 'Fatigue' could take up an inventory slot, and require the mage to either spend an action to drop fatigue, creating a tradeoff between loot, armor and magic. The spell itself may also take up inventory in the form of a spell book. This system creates a reason for mages to avoid dumping their constitution stat, if constitution impacts the carry limit.
(I think I saw this in some GLOG related post)

### : blood magic
what happens when a mage runs out of their normal casting resources? Are they reduced to picking up a sharp stick for defense?

I think it's cooler if the mage can also cast using their HP when things get really desperate, but maybe this is an ability restricted to a specific class.
