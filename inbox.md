### Fearful Words
Few people will not abide liars, the weak willed, or idiots in serious conversation. The habits of speech common in
these types of people take power away from their words. These habits all have fear as a common root.

1. The fear of being left out leads to a desire to look good and to be affirmed. This can lead to one-upmanship,
    self-aggrandising lies, a patronizing tone, and fake listening while really preparing what to say next.
2. The fear of being wrong leads to a desire to always be right. This leads to aggressive convincing and kills true
    listening and learning.
3. The fear of being disliked leads to people pleasing. This leads to yes-men type behavior which restricts you to a 
    passive role in the conversation.
4. The fear of hurting someone's feelings leads to the perpetual need to make things right, which can lead to 
    withholding of useful information, and obstructs real solutions.

These four fears lead to seven habits which make it difficult to be around people who have them.

1. Gossiping, or speaking ill of someone who is absent, destroys your own reputation. Quickly everyone will realize that
    this person will be speaking ill behind their back as soon as they leave.
2. Judging, not as careful evaluation, but condemning, makes it hard to take your words at face value, since your
    opinion is heavily colored by your prejudice
    - what they say comes loaded, so it's difficult to take at face value
3. Negativity is just hard to be around all of the time
4. complaining can start viral misery
    - forgetting gratitude, which is important to a happy life
5. Excuses, excuses. Those that never accept responsibility for anything are full of shit.
6. Embellishing or lying makes makes nuance hard to express when you want to, and make people question everything you
    say after a while. No one is interested in listening to a liar.
7. dogmatism, or to confuse opinions and facts, again makes it hard for people to take your word.

1. consolidate the promising ideas
    
## Intro
The gnosis is play, or the dream trance
* the beginners mind
* power of habit
Mastery is a quality difficult to cultivate, but which has enormous rewards both internally and externally. Mastery is
the fusion of deep functional knowledge (the result of years of practice), creative application (breaking from
established forms), and a return to the beginners mind (intuitive grasp). People who regularly experience mastery at
work are highly paid, highly regarded, and report higher job and life satisfaction. Put another way, any existing
passion you feel for your dream career/life will be chipped away unless you regularly feel like you have the autonomy
to creatively express yourself in a way that has a real impact for the people you are helping. It truly sucks if you
are a slave to someone's whim, must always follow the script, or have zero meaningful impact.

* everyday joking and musing is a low level creativity. even children do this kind of simple association. It is a basic function of the brain (and essential to [memory](reality.md#memory))
* a lifetime of learning expands the playground available for creativity
* high level creativity requires vast knowledge and the willingness and ability to freely explore that space, connecting new ideas
* return to childlike creativity, but an adult mindscape (serious play)

# focus
micro
* holding the attention
macro
* goal setting
* finding direction

* what you look for is what you will see
## Intro
The mind does not crave rest, it craves change. Do not NOT think for a moment. Be ever present or plotting

Focus is as much about figuring out what to pay attention to as about figuring out what to leave out.
*  on social media/draining the shallows (deep work)
*  purity/volume/value of information streams

Your life is precious because it will end, so focus on the wildly important.
Death is a non-thing, only an end of the thing we call life. You will not be there to experience it when it comes,
because it is a non-experience. Why fear something that you will never experience? On the other hand, it will happen to
you. Your time is limited and so remember to spend it well. Worrying about death is a particularly stupid way to do so.
The purpose of remembering death is not to be depressed, but to serve as a reminder to focus on what you really care
about. Remember death to intensify the experience of living. This is the purpose of 'Memento Mori'.
* memento mori
* precious human rebirth
* The gods are doomed because they will live forever
* focus on the wildly important, cut everything else (esp. vice)
	* fear is the mind-killer
* avoid comfortable lies, constant outrage and wishful thinking

# Cut out the unimportant

* virtual assistants (tim ferris)
* putting things out of your mind (lists) or dealing with intrusive thoughts/obsessions
* checklists
* journaling
* dissociation meditation
* effective executive * time audits
    * yearly "intensive month" for increased time tracking and moving forward, other long term calendars

* draining the shallows
    * be wary of taking on shallow work
    * schedule every minute of the day to stay mindful of the value proposition.
        * the schedule is to force forethought, so it should flex and be updated continuously
    * in every moment: "what is the most valuable thing to do right now?"
    * quantify the depth of every task: "how long would it take to train a smart but naive new grad to complete the task?"
        * for super shallow work, it might even be effective to actually do so
    * timebox your work, then optimize to fit the time
    * be hard to reach, make them work for it, set expectations early, and cut down back and forths/low stakes negotiations. Don't respond.
* cutting out distractions can reveal certain mental/emotional issues. Ignoring them will not make them go away. Need to
    deal with these as they arise or always be running.
## Cut to the heart
* single pointed concentration
* attention training technique

## taming the mind ruth#2
1. start by relaxing your body
2. focus on the breath
3. decrease wandering, perhaps with a mantra
4. practice 20-30 minutes a day

the reward for taming the mind is clarity of thought

## agency
> You are radically responsible

In taichi they say you are the axis and the whole world turns with
you.

You are the cause and effect. You can change all aspects of your mind with effort. Since you experience all things
through your mind, that change will affect all things in your life. You are radically responsible for who you are as a
person because you are radically in control of who you are.

* primal curiosity (greene)
    * (mastery) what did I naturally gravitate to before feeling social pressure?
* learning objectives

### principles by ray dalio
don't let failure stop you
* think of life as if it were a game in which each problem and failure is a puzzle that needs solving
* pain + reflection = progress
how:
* be radically open-minded to feedback. ask 'what am I missing', and 'how can I get honest feedback'
* find the root cause of your problems. It often uncovers some character or process flaw. Don't shy away from self reflection.
Once you've found the cause of failure
* put a process in place to mitigate the failure
* learn to eliminate the problem
* hire out someone to handle it
* DON'T just avoid the circumstances leading to failure
Whatever process you come up with, write them down.; Making your process/principles clear and explicit (and reviewing them) will make them more consistent.
## Goal Setting
* set goals/practices/systems and iterate
* pre-commital
* thinking in bets
* john Boyd OODA loop
* effective executive * career/life experiments
    * career experiements
    * occlumency as related to career experiments, fake it til you make it

The __outcome__ should be framed directly in terms of the metric you chose.

The __metric__ is the way you will measure your progress. It is demoralizing not to be able to see progress over time.
 It is also hard to be sure you *are* progressing if you don't know how to measure.

The __deadline__ should leave plenty of time to account for unexpected hang ups, but not too far ahead. The main benefit
 behind a deadline is it gives you a way to measure how your progress stacks up to what it should be in order to hit
  your outcome at the set date. It allows you to focus on progress rather than only on the final number.

The __process__ is how you will work towards the goal. When you first are setting your goal, it is useful to know the
 process in at least broad terms so that you can effectively estimate the required effort to complete the goal. Knowing
  the process, and therefore the (approximate) effort, will help you decide if the goal is worth it.

__Desire__ is the 'why' of your goal.

Working on long term projects can be difficult, and sometimes it will suck so bad you won't want to continue.
 __Commitment__ is useful to power through these times. It is a logic to temper the natural fluctuations in an emotional
  desire to complete the task.

__Barriers__ to your success should be well understood. There is always a reason you haven't already completed your
 goal. When you explicitly acknowledge why, you can then form a plan to work around these barriers.

## clarify intent ruth#4
essentially a trantric practice of visualizing the self as the ideal.
1. sit quietly and close your eyes
2. think of a goal
3. relax the body
4. empty the mind
1. visualize yourself as having accomplished your goal. breath with it
1. feel the positive emotions associated. experience the joy of turning a thought into reality
1. once you have felt the feeling of accomplishment, add details to your vision. Exactly how do you look? where are you? how are people responding to you? add as much detail as possible
1. repeat 1-2 times daily for 10-30 minutes. 
1. each time you will find you are refining the vision in your unconscious
## SMART

Sometimes these components are framed differently as __SMART__. This method puts a slightly different emphasis on
 various components.

* __S__ pecific - break goals down into the smallest component pieces that make sense. 
* __M__ easureable - it's important to be able to see progress and know when you are done.
* __A__ ttainable - make sure the goal is possible for you and your situation.
* __R__ elevant - make sure the goal is relevant to you. This gets into the desire aspect. You should have a clear
    picture of *why* you want to accomplish this.
* __T__ imebound - deadlines are motivating to some people, and having one allows you to gauge if you are on track when
    taken together with your metric.

alternative meanings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mi9_XEXQqc
Agreed on
Realistic
Time-based

While this covers many of the same bases, I believe it presents an incomplete picture.

#### Pitfalls | Goalsetting Anti-patterns
Let's explore what can happen when one of these components is missing or improperly constructed.

If you don't know *what* you want to accomplish, you will waste time working hard on things which won't advance the
goal. If you don't know *how* to complete the goal, you probably won't make progress. Spending the time to learn how is
well worth it. If you don't really *want* to complete a difficult goal, you probably won't put in the effort. Desire is
necessary to get through the tough bits.

* large goals (not specific, too many metrics)
* vague goals (not measurable, no metric)
* ambitious/unrealistic goals( not attainable)
* spurious goals ( not relevant/desired)
* half-ass goals ( not committed)

* lack of followthrough (no commitment)
* inaccurate effort estimates
* insufficient progress (no deadline, ineffective process)

### the benefits and pitfalls of goal setting
#### the benefits
* if a person has the knowledge and skill, there is a linear relationship between goal difficulty and the person's
    performance.
* goals that are specific and difficult lead to a higher performance than a vague goal.
* feeling 'success' does not depend on absolute performance, but performance in relation to one's goals.
* when people perform well, they generalize the positive affect to the task, liking the task more than they did
    previously.
* goal setting can relieve boredom by imbuing tasks with a sense of purpose, leading to higher focus
* Potential rewards of praise, public recognition, and money have no effect on performance unless they lead to the
    setting of and commitment to a specific high goal.
* believing that you have taken on difficult goals leads to an increase in reported positive emotion, job satisfaction,
    and feelings of success in the workplace.
* the negative effects of a lack of personal goal achievement can be mitigated when goal progression is experienced at
    work.
* in summary, the benefits include
    * goals affect our choices and provide direction
    * goals increase effort, persistence, and process efficiency
    * a goal can provide meaning to an otherwise (personally) meaningless task
    * goal attainment gives rise to a sense of personal accomplishment, which in turn increases our sense of personal
        effectiveness, a a basic psychological need.
#### the pitfalls
* when people lack the knowledge and skill to attain a specific performance goal, performance falters. A performance
    goal may direct cognitive resources to sheer effort when it would be more appropriate to first gather more
     information, or learn new skills.
* performance goals can have a negative effect on a group's performance if there is a perceived conflict of interest
    among group members.
    * when goals are perceived to be competitively related, members are tempted to pursue their own goal single-mindedly
    * when goals are perceived to be independent, members are likely to keep interaction to a minimum.
    * only when goals are perceived to be cooperatively aligned does the group experience a boost in productivity.
    * therefore it is vitally important that high-level goals are framed in a cooperative way.
* goals that are framed as a threat (a punishment for failure, rather than a reward for success) are not effective.
* goals can have an adverse effect on risk-taking. 
    * this can lead to rigid and ineffective behavior
    * It is important to frame failures as learning opportunities
    * this allows failures to yield useful information, rather than being a waste of time.
    * mistakes are inevitable in any non-trivial task. make the most of them through error management
    * providing ample opportunity to make mistakes and make every effort to learn from them.
* when failure is harshly punished, less difficult or vague goals are likely to become the norm.
    * it is better to view mistakes as transitory, and part of the learning process.
* another barrier to goal setting is, paradoxically, goal attainment.
    * goal attainment leads to higher satisfaction and self-confidence which can frequently lead to a dysfunctional
        persistence of previously used strategies (rigid behaviour).
    * there are two antidotes
    * in dynamic situations, actively search for feedback and react to it. break down large goals and always be mindful
        of errors. Errors in previously successful tasks show where the mental model may not account for a changing
        situation.
    * encourage constructive conflict. In groups, appoint 'nay sayers' and rotate the position frequently. The purpose is
        to combat group think, by always having someone question and look for flaws in the proposed solution. 
* goals that are tied to large rewards can encourage people to fudge the numbers when they are close to attainment, but
    can't quite close the deal. One approach to mitigate this effect is to implement a continuous linear reward. Hitting
    the goal receives the whole reward, but getting close also merits part of the reward.
* the next pitfall occurs when a goal becomes idealized and tied up in identity. this can lead to irrational and risky
    action to obtain the goal regardless of possible cost and consequence. Identity is an exceptionally powerful
    motivator. When a goal gets intermixed with identity, failure can be seen as personally threatening and is responded 
    to with maladaptive, defensive behaviors.
* non-goal performance dimensions can be ignored. This is a function of the purpose of goals, which is to provide
    direction and focus efforts. By definition, less attention must be paid to other aspects. If a certain outcome or
    action is critical, a goal should be set for it.
* goals can be stressful. attempt to keep the number of goals reasonable. before committing to goals, make sure that
    there is a base level of relevant skill, resources, and self-confidence. Taking on too much at once is a recipe for 
    failure.

#### The Goal Setting | The Process
this mirrors the grand rite
1. get to the root desire
2. determine the metrics
3. break it down to single metrics
4. set the desired outcome and deadline
5. break it down again if you need to.
6. come up with an initial process.
7. determine what barriers exist and come up with a plan for dealing with them.
8. start measuring the metrics (if you can) and let it sit for a little bit.
9. fully commit, then get started. always record the metric.

#### Continuous Improvement | Kaizen continuous growth
* continuous self improvement
    + record daily status
    + look for opportunities to learn
One application of this process is known as kaizen.
This method, called kaizen in japan, is a simple method used to slowly and steadily effect personal change. There are no 
short cuts here. It is similar to the idea that being just 0.1% better every day will still lead to exponential growth 
if you keep at it (resulting in being twice as good over 2 years).

This is perhaps the most important section of the whole book. If you follow only one practice, follow this one. It can 
help determine the trajectory of your life.

1. decide what you want to become
    * make a long list
    * don't hold back
2. pick ONLY one
3. write a list of reasons that this isn't you yet
    * bring out the blockers so they can be addressed
    * pick one (small) and move up
    * start at the end, what would have to happen to make this real and work backwards
4. pick one and stick with it until it becomes easy 

## Generating Emotion

* [compassion](society.md#compassion)
* motivation

### Motivation
* The grand gesture / sacrifice
* scoreboarding
* lead measures
* accountability cadence
* mantra
* mental contrasting

Motivation will arise when you know three things:
* the task motivator, or why the task is important
* how to complete the task
* that you can finish the task

The 6 Types of motivators
There are 6 types of motivators, roughly ordered here by strength, which account for the vast majority of motivations
behind all human accomplishments:
1. survival (food, water, shelter, sex)
2. identity (honor, integrity, in-group politics)
3. compassion
4. play
5. internal motivators (for personal gain/satisfaction/curiosity)
6. external motivators (to impress others, reputation)

Deeply understanding the motivation behind each goal is essential to ensure that the goal will correctly address the
underlying desire.

Nothing kills motivation quite so quickly as feeling powerless to make change.
The point is not to become an expert before beginning, but to gain an rough idea and reduce doubt about the process.

![a chart showing the dunning-kruger effect](sources/dunning_kruger.jpg)

analysis paralysis
dunning-kruger


Knowing the different types of motivation can also be used as a catalyst for generating motivation. Playful intention 
can be created by gamifying
the task. Internal motivators can be added by promising yourself a reward. Compassion based motivation can be generated 
by ensuring that your work
will help someone else. Imagine just one person whose life could be made better by what you're doing, and do it for 
them.

#### mental contrasting
a balanced approach to visualizing success (that you can in fact complete the task) and obstacles (a realistic account
 of future difficulty)
* mental contrasting https://www.happierhuman.com/mental-contrasting/
    - may have limited empirical evidence
    - smells like it is placebo based

#### Technique Summary
If you find your motivation wavering, ask yourself these three questions:
1. Can you do it?
    - When asking yourself this, visualize not only the attainment of the goal, but also the struggles along the way.
2. Will it work?
    - Will completing this goal address the underlying issue?
3. Is it worth it?
    - After reflecting on the effort required and the benefit of pursuing your task, with the confidencethat you can do
     it if you make the effort, is the goal worth it?

will it work?
* Do you know enough about the problem to make a reasonable guess at a process that will be effective and that will solve the underlying issue?
* if you don't perhaps focus on learning more, but don't be afraid of uncertainty. A reasonable guess is all that you need to proceed.

Can you do it?
* Visualize success and acknowledge obstacles as realistically as possible.
* acknowledge and address shortcomings in skill and knowledge if you can't yet.

Is it worth it?
* now, knowing the path forward, and that you are capable, is the cost worth the reward? weight the consequences

By focusing on and answering these three questions, you can maintain motivation for even the most grueling tasks, when
 it's really important.
I recommend you commit them to memory. If you answer a hard no to any of the three, examine the reason why closely. This
 is a barrier that will keep you from success. 
It may be time to refine or even abandon the goal.

## gratitude 
journaling
gratitude has been shown to have a lasting impact on people's happiness

Once or twice weekly, write down 5 things you are grateful for. That's it.

tips
* the point is to 'feel' the gratitude, so don't just go through the motions
* get personal and drill down
* Imagine life without
* savor the surprises
* don't overdo it

## Resisting Emotion
> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my
> fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its 
> path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” -- Frank Herbert, Dune

* mindfulness based emotional balance MBEB
* mindfulness based stress reduction MBSR
* resisting vice
* anxiety (into the magic shop)
* stoicism
* CBT
* managing anger
## performing under pressure
Feeling social or time pressure to perform statistically has a hugely negative impact on performance, but there are ways to reframe these feelings.
Get excited:
* interpret nervous energy as excitement rather than panic, or trying to suppress the feeling

Equate:
* the effort needed to perform in a high stakes environment is exactly the same effort needed in a low stakes environment.
* equate the test to the practice exam, something you've handled already

Control:
* focus only on the aspects you can control. Its more important that you give a presentation well (something you control) than that the presentation is well received (something you don't).

These three aspects lead to three sentences which can be said before a high performance event.
The high pressure mantra:
I am excited to perform.
In a way, it's just like how I prepared.
I'll just focus on what I can control.

## Forming and Breaking Habits
While constant self-control is a herculean task, forming a habit is the easiest thing in the world. Leveraging habits is
 an effective way to enact long term changes.

The Anatomy of a Habit
* trigger
* expectation
* response 
* feedback

Often we think of the response as a single unit of action, but really, if the habit takes more than about 2 minutes to 
complete, then only the initial action is the response. This can be leveraged. habits are usefaul because they reduce
the cognitive load associated iwth routine tasks and can be leveraged to make self-discipline easier. However, habit 
become maladaptive when they persist when the positive feedback is no longer a result of the response, or the habit has 
negative long term effects.

habits form naturally when
* the trigger is noticable and regular
* the expectation is high
* the response is easy to do
* the feedback is intermittent/random, and matches the expectation
habits are naturally time sensitive.

The way to form and break habits are opposite sides of a coin. Each technique focuses on changing characteristics of the
 trigger, response, or feedback in a way that makes the habit as a whole more or less addictive. Let's treat each of 
 these components in turn, first dissecting what makes them strong, then weak

#### strengthening triggers
* stack habits together, use an established habit as the cue for a new one.

#### weakening triggers
The next best way is to eliminate the trigger by changing the environment. This is harder because often the trigger is
 mental, or the environment cannot be strictly controlled.

#### strengthening expectation
the expectation is strong when it is massively positive or negative. Also when it is intermittent, this is why gambling
 is so addictive.
* increase the expected value of a task by tying something enjoyable to the completion of a task
* also, make feedback slightly intermittent

#### weakening expectation
the expectation is weak when the feedback is predictable and mostly neutral.
* temper expectations by requiring an unpleasant activity to go along with the response you are trying to get rid of. 
  It is important that the unpleasantness comes *before* the old response, and as soon as possible after the cue, so the
  cue becomes associated strongly with a new expected value.
* do something else, besides the conditioned response, that you enjoy at least as much. The trigger will start to be 
associated with that instead.

#### strengthening responses
a response is strong when it is easy.
* instead of thinking of all the parts of the habit, only consider the first step as the 'habit'. Reading just one page
 of a book after work is a habit that's easy enough,
  and you'll probably end up reading more anyway.
* set up the environment to make it easy to get started.

#### weakening responses
a response is hard when it takes a lot of time or energy to get started
* when you feel the trigger, consider every step and inconvenience along the whole reponse
* craft the environment to make it hard to get started. Put the cookie jar in a hard to reach place.

#### strengthening feedback
* track your progress with a metric! keep that streak

#### weakening feedback
kill the positive feedback loop. This can be done by devaluing the anticipated reward by constraining the environment to
eliminate the reward, or make it difficult to access, etc. This method still requires some effort, as habits have 
momentum, and often won't disappear even if positive feedback is limited or intermittent.

## Conclusion
recommended habits to develop
- morning routine/mantra
- journaling
- reading
- meditation
- exercise
- reaching out to friends
- reaching out to experts of interesting fields

* when dealing with particularly sticky habits, it may be helpful to enlist a trusted friend as an accountability 
    partner.
* when trying to form new habits it is useful to be aware of existing habits of action and thought. Mindfulness is super
    useful to figure out where you're at!
* some habits serve as cornerstones for a major change in behavior (james clear domino effect).

# Memory
## how do we pass on knowledge?
This is an attempt to create a syncretic mnemonic device combining a variety of historic and modern memory techniques
in order to produce a 'one-stop-shop' for memory training that balances complexity (and therefore time invested) with
suitability for the kinds of memory tasks I care about.

In contrast to popular historical techniques which are usually described very simply, or competition techniques, which
require large investment for a very specific application, this tries to take the middle path.

#
* idea/concept - a thought independent of any thinker/mind (egregore)
* knowledge - a concept as understood by a mind
* understanding - knowledge as it is applied in a particular moment
  * tacit understanding - the mind has an intuition about a concept, but the underlying theory is not strong enough to reason about it symbolically
  * objective understanding - the mind takes a concept as an object of thought and effectively manipulates it symbolically
  * ingrained understanding - intuitions about the concept influence the thoughts at the conscious level, but it is abstracted and not manipulated directly (as an object of thought)

at a great enough depth, all knowledge is tacit, the important factor is if ingrained understanding goes deep enough to capture the complexity needed
to effectively work at the level of abstraction desired/required.

distributed understanding is a very shallow kind of objecting knowledge in which deeper understanding is known to be accessible, but is not directly known.
Knowing what to look for, or who to ask and when implies some understanding about the shape and use of the concept, but
accessing distributed understanding is slow, which hinders effective use (if deeper understanding is necessary).

abstract/objective dichotomy
unable to become objective - lacks depth of understanding
unable to become abstract - not ingrained through practice enough for intuition
objective thought allows symbolic manipulation
abstact thought allows faster intuition
## theory of memory
when memorizing data, consider its shape and purpose, arrange it into an appropriate structure.
Then, using insight into the underlying mechanics of the brain, encode that structure.

* mechanics of the brain
  * association & salience
  * forgetting curve
  * spaced repetition
  * active recall (modal transformation)
  * specialized structures
    * spatial memory
    * smell
    * faces
    * narrative
    * external objects
    * audio
    * models
* kinds of data
  * qualia
    * distributed - not existing within a single mind. 
      * Could be organizational, or partially stored externally
    * explicit - consciously held. 
    * implicit - unconsciously held
    * objective - consciously reasoned with
    * embodied - unconsciously reasoned with
  * base collections

    * durability / permanence
    * context sensitivity, time-relevance
* extant techniques for explicit memory
  * memory palace
  * spaced repetition
  * peg,Major,PAO
  * slant words, association, etc.
  * abstraction/metaphor/modeling
    * a (good) model is necessarily less complicated but easier to reason about in most cases
* RPD - transforming explicit/implicit and embodied/objective knowledge into explicit/objective knowledge for transfer and storage
  * through this, allowing the use of explicit memory techniques
  * practice - objective to embodied transformation
  * mirroring/coaching - implicit transfer
  * introspection/interviewing - implicit to explicit transformation + transfer
  * teaching - explicit transfer
  * intergenerational knowledge transfer

## Design - how the system works
## Theory - how memory works
short-term memory and long-term consolidation

things are easier to remember if they are:
* more concrete (as opposed to abstract)
* related to other things you know
* surprising/funny/alarming/sexy / disgusting / rage inducing
* personally important

spaced repetition helps store things in long term memory. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a very powerful tool for this.
In other words cramming doesn't work very well, especially if you want to remember it after the test.

multimodal exposure
* provides a richer experience
* transforming data from one modality to another forces close attention

## Source Techniques
Fundamental to all memory techniques is the encoding of abstract information in concrete symbolism.

The Memory Palace is a common metaphor which places objects (ideas made concrete) in a physical place with the appropriate structure.
* ordered items are placed along a path
* unordered collections are placed in a room
  Once placed, mentally travelling through the space lets you 'see' the objects there as reminders.
  Many other techniques build upon this metaphor.

The memory palace technique can be augmented with skipping indexes. Commonly every 5th element is associated. This
allows for faster traversal of the list. It generates a [skip list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list)

Another fundamental technique is grouping or clustering, which composes multiple points of data into a single object.
This helps circumvent the issue of limited short-term memory.

History walks are an application of the memory palace where distance represents time.

Person-action-object is a competition system used to memorize numbers.
It works by first memorizing a list of 100 people along with their distinct actions and objects
which are numbered 00 through 99. In this way 6 digits (2 per person, action, or object) can be clustered into a single
scene.

Mandalas are used to organize topical knowledge around a theme. Typically, the central theme is placed centrally,
with related knowledge around it in a circle.

## The system
The core is PAO, with special consideration towards the selection of people so that they may also provide anchors
for extended topics.
A PAO memory system that doubles as anchors for other memory systems
* 100 historical figures with actions and objects to remember long digits
  * selected to be spread out in time to remember historical dates
* 11 fictional characters (with actions and objects) to serve as single digits (or no digit)

topics
Start collecting Memory Palaces
* paths
* rooms (order locations in the room so it can be used as a list or a set)
* grid

## Mechanics - how the system is represented by the computer
I do not want to the mnemonic device to be reliant upon computers for either construction or training.
I think it important to keep the method workable by hand, even if a computer speeds things along.
To this end, the data is written by hand in a csv format that emphasizes readability and the script is deliberately
straightforward and readable.

### memory book
A good memory is always useful.

The trained memory is an art of attention and association. All systems are tuned to promote original awareness of the
object. Also, tangible and meaningful things are easier to remember, so other techniques exist to convert the abstract
and random  into concrete ideas. Periodic recall will solidify the memory once made. In order to remember any new thing
it must be associated to something already known. Bonus points if it's done in some ridiculous, inspiring or profound 
way. This creates what's called a link. The whole rest of the art is practice, the willingness to apply it, and
acquiring the symbolic language necessary to concretize the abstract.
Place more value in memorizing things which change slowly, and that will be useful in uncertain circumstances.

meta:
* the true art is original awareness
* learn the symbols
* practice makes perfect. apply it everywhere

make it easy:
* concretize
* link to what you know
* make it ridiculous, inspiring, profound, or startling
* set up a cadence of periodic recall
* value on things that won't change more highly

* In order to remember an object, you first must be intensely aware of the the object
* Images and tangible things are much easier to remember than the abstract
* memory is formed by the association of the new to an established memory
* abstractions can be given tangible approximations in order to make them easier to remember

the memory palace
If you've heard of any of these memory techniques, it's probably the memory palace.
The traditional practice of memory techniques is centered around the memory palace. It uses to mind's particular ability
to picture tangible objects in relation to each other to codify associations between thngs. Sequential data is codified
in a 'walk' of a place, which puts distinct places into an order. This has been used for centuries to prepare speeches.

example concretizers:
* slant words - similar sounding, but concrete phrases
* key words - representing whole ideas, especially good for presentations
* start and stop - link the first item of the list to a cue in the environment where you will need to remember. link the last item to a stopping symbol, or back to the cue.
* names - slant the name and link it to a caricature of their face.
* out of place objects can serve as cues
* numbers
* peg words - use number words as an index to access a list of items out of order.
* mutilation - destroy or alter a linked item to mark it as complete, or in another way. Use multiple methods of desctruction for multiple markers.
    eg: water, fire, animals
* day of the week - talk about the time sigil 622502514624
* speed reading - there is a limit to your eye speed, but most slow downs come from regressions. Link, summarize and cross reference as you go to read once and know it.
    use page numbers as pegs for bonus points
* mem graphs - overlay tabular or map data with a grid of numbers and letters. the quadrant word is linked to the data.

#### grouping ideas
Short term memory seems to be about 7 things, but those things can be information dense groupings

idea compactions
* groupings (heirarchy)
* PAO
	* consider writing up GPAO separately
	* integrate with
		* major system
		* pitman shorthand
* just the gist
* compact representations
* numbers as words
reuse the same structure or relations for similar objects.

* advanced data structures in as memory techniques?
    - trees
    - linked lists
    - quad trees
    - geographic maps
* static vs dynamic groups
* trees
* proximity
*  sequences
    * linked placement
    * narrative

#### numbers
* PAO exists, but is probably overkill (pareto)
digit <-> sound
* 1 -> t d
* 2 -> n
* 3 -> m
* 4 -> r
* 5 -> l
* 6 -> j sh ch
* 7 -> k c g
* 8 -> f v ph
* 9 -> p b
* 0 -> z s c
add vowels as necessary to create words
focus on phonetics, not spelling

A deep understanding of various simple datastructures will help in coming up with more advanced applications

# knowledge

The gnosis is close understanding and clear observation
Reality will assert itself whether you are prepared for it or not. Wishful thinking will leave you blindsided.
Therefore try to be informed enough to spot the most obvious bullshit in the widest range of topics.
Learn deeply the topics you care about, and validate what you learn for yourself as much as possible.
Also, tolerate uncertainty. Thinking in black and white is a gross simplification of the world that is much more dangerous than people realize.
The world at large is an too vast for the human mind to fully comprehend every detail and professing certainty where 
there is none will only trick yourself into trusting your faulty model of the world instead of your actual experience of it.
* be informed and validate for yourself
* tolerate uncertainty, (negative capability)
* grow the ideascape. make this a priority


## grand rite of skill learning
The grand rite is a meta-pattern that describes a way to tackle a problem. The applications (and therefore the forms)
of this ritual are nearly endless. I'll describe the pattern, then a few applications.
* the ULP

Stated in the purest form:
1. Learn just enough to self correct
    seek source material, mentors and other outside perspectives to jump start your mental model of the problem.
1. Identify barriers
    note what might hinder practice and specific failures that might arise.
1. make an effort to eliminate the barriers
    Any potential failure becomes a pain point to work through. Make use of mental contrasting
1. break down the task into its smallest components
    identify single aspects of the task as they relate to a specific failure mode, rank by importance / frequency in 
    the high level skill
1. Identify the desired outcome
    create a SMART goal. Take your metric and simply measure where you are for a while.
1. Identify the process
    how do you move in the right direction considering where you are?
1. Accelerate towards failure
    iterate. fail early and often. Figure out how to fail softly. Iterate on your process to speed up feedback loops
    and fail faster. Form new theories and learn to test quickly.
    * deliberate practice as a series of methodical micro-experiments (so good they can't ignore you)
1. Review and consolidate
    simplify the model. Generalize and recontextualize your findings. Go through a retrospective or recap, and review it
    periodically as needed.

## learning
* pomodoro technique
* spaced repetition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)
* 20 hr rule
    * imagine disaster - as a way to break down the most essential parts and get a clear picture of a target performance
        level
    * know just enough - to get started, anything more is procrastination. Academic knowledge of a skill rarely is 
        sufficient, figure out the flow and feel, then start practicing to really get it.
        - monitor hypothesis 
            - learning is only valuable if it allows you to plan edit and correct yourself while practicing
        - practice raises more questions, and can lead to informed discussions with experts
    * struggle & sleep - break practice into short sessions followed by a nap/sleep, within four hours of sleep.
        Intensity is important too.

Effective practice
* peak - anders ericsson & robert pool on deliberate practice
    * deliberate practice generate effective mental representations
    * these representations allow
        - recreating experiences
        - making accurate predictions
        - condensing information
    * four components of purposeful practice
        - have a specific goal
        - practice sessions were intense
        - received immediate feedback
        - frequent discomfort, frequent mistakes
    * force a creative insight, or feel repeated discomfort
    * with expert coaching, we can adopt effective mental representations to jump start the practice
    * purposeful methods + expert coaching = deliberate practice
    * deliberate practice by nature is uncomfortable because it is a process of stretching your limits
* logical fallacies as barriers to learning
also, how to deal with false information? guarding against epistemic closure (in the sense of confirmation bias) in 
adaptive information systems. The quality of learning is highly dependant on the correctness of the input data.
* feynman technique often the best way to learn something is to teach it to others
    * also from feynman, keep a set of problems, and whenever you get something new, apply it all of those problems
        if something pans out you'll be seen as a genius.
        * problems and techniques (research and development) are opposite ends of the solution path. Applying A* dijkstra's reduces the search space.

a curriculum is set up to change behavior and supply a context for that behavioral change, not only to supply
information. thus curricular objectives should specify context and behavior, bound together by high level philosophy 
(since not everything can be covered, every exclusion is political), not necessarily specific information to be 
conveyed. basic principles of curriculum and instruction by ralph w tyler

the philosophical basis of learning should be self consistent, focused, partially derived from norms and balanced with 
necessities of reality and the interests of the student.

5 elements of effective thinking
* earth: what are the core components?
    box the unknowns and get the structure
* air: perspective shifting questions "what if I...?"
    look at things like a beginner, a pro, or a customer
* fire: how can I make more mistakes?
    run experiments and check failure modes
* water: how can I build on whats working/iterate?
* wood: identify as a life long learner
    the only constant in your thinking should be change

goal setting in a group context
In order to make progress towards a goal, you first have to know what the goal is.
In this section we cover the anatomy of a goal and a process for goal creation. Then, we describe one way that you could
 apply these methods in a process of continuous self improvement.

## the grand rite of seeing the truth
the scientific method

1. observe and ask questions, research
    * when do you trust authority, or work it out yourself
    * direct experience
    * how much information, and of what type is necessary for a decent hypothesis?
1. formulate a hypothesis
    * how to make a testable hypothesis
1. test your hypothesis
    * crafting experiments that look to falsify your hypothesis
1. conclude
    * simplify the model
    * review
    * share the results
## Observation
* simple awareness training
* observation meditations
* internal and external contexts
* seeing more clearly
#### The test of time and distance
Another consideration is ensuring that the information here isn't lost through the ages. some encodings are effective
only in the short term. Stories that rely heavily on cultural touchstones will lose meaning across the world. Songs that
 use clever rhyme may lose their cleverness through shifts in accent and across languages. Memes usually die within the
 week.

### Chaos Magic
Symbolic ritual (psychodrama) that is focused on results rather than tradition.
Belief, symbolism and ritual become tools to be experimented with and used when useful rather than dogmatically
That is not to say that the tools are interchangable. The specifics of the spell have a major impact ofn its efficacy, but the necessary specifics vary on an individual basis.
Understand the pattern so you can improvise.

principles
* avoid dogma
* validate through personal experience
* strive for technical excellence, rigorous experimantation and iteration
* de-condition old patterns of thought. unify the force and create fluidity of perspective
* value diverse approaches
* gnosis

## Reasoning
* formal logic
* baysian reasoning
* lesswrong
* cognitive bias
    * confirmation bias

The Manhood of Humanity is a book whose essential thesis is that man is a time binder, differentiated from the rest of nature by the ability to retain experiences and transmit them across generations. --Alfred Korzybski

# living artfully
* taste-ability gap
* skill starts from the mechanical level
    * if you want to draw it starts by making marks on a page, how to hold the pen, etc. really care directly about these things, but they are necessary to get to the part you care about.
    * eventually you do these things automatically, without conscious thought
    * your thoughts turn to higher levels (color, shape, weight..)
    * eventually you forget about these things and think instead about the gestalt
