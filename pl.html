<h1>Programming Language Design</h1><p>
What ought to be considered when designing a programming language?
While it can be fun to make a language focused on a single aspect for a side project with a single user, language designers need to consider a vast array of things in order to create a language with wide appeal. A new language must bring something new to the table in order to compete, while at the same time providing the niceties expected of an established language.
<p>
What follows is a list of things to consider, which aims to be more or less exhaustive. Users will typically decide whether or not to use a language based on one or more of these considerations. This is not to say that its pointless to make a language without considering all these aspects. Language design can be a challenge and satisfying for its own sake.
<p>
<h2>Basis</h2><p>
What is the core reason for this language to exist and be used?
<p>
Possible reasons include:
<ul>
<li>It solves problems within a given domain better than a general language.
</li>
<li>It solves a particular gripe about developing in another language.
</li>
<li>It has platform exclusivity (like javascript in the browser).
</li>
<li>It was fun to build.
</li>
<li>It is fun to use.
</li>
<li>A bad case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">:NIH syndrome</a>
</li>
<li>It encourages solving problems in a novel way.
</li>
<li>It eliminates certain classes of programming errors.
</li>
<li>It is easy to port.
</li>
<li>It is small, and therefore easy to grok.
</li>
<li>It is large, and therefore can do everything.
</li>
<li>It introduces novel or experimental features.
</li></ul><p>
Clearly, not every language needs all of these reasons to exist, and some reasons contradict others. The point is that a new language should have at least one.
<p>
<h2>Semantics</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>What <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">:programming paradigms</a> are supported? Which are encouraged?
</li>
<li>What are the built-in types?
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function">:first class functions?</a>
</li>
<li>What metaprogramming or preprocessor is available?
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">:homoiconicity?</a>
</li>
<li>Is the preprocessor language the same as the full language, a subset, or totally distinct?
</li></ul><li>concurrency? parallelism? async? system threads vs language threads
<ul>
<li>how is state safely shared between threads?
</li></ul><li>type system? static? dynamic (duck)? hinting?
<ul>
<li>Implicit casting?
</li>
<li>Implicit broadcasting/ <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2024-06-17-automap.html">function lifting?</a>
</li>
<li>Generics?
</li></ul><li>What happens when a computation has no result? do you have (Null nil NaN None)?
</li>
<li>What values are considered false (perhaps null, 0, '')?
</li>
<li>What scopes are there? how are names resolved?
<ul>
<li>how does global scope behave? especially when multithreaded
</li>
<li>lexical(static) vs dynamic scope, closures
</li>
<li>do you have file-local or other scopes?
</li>
<li>How do you reference libraries and/or code in the same project but a different file?
</li></ul><li>Statements vs expressions
</li>
<li>what flow control structures
</li>
<li>manual memory management or garbage collection?
</li></ul><p>
<h2>Syntax</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>How familiar/weird is the syntax? What's the closest extant language or language family?
</li>
<li>How does the syntax support/enforce the dominant paradigms?
<ul>
<li>usually syntax used heavily in the dominant paradigm is shorter
</li></ul><li>How visually distinct are distinct language constructs?
<ul>
<li>Are similar constructs visually similar?
</li>
<li>visual similarity here is informally related to edit distance. How much typing is needed to make a subtle semantic change?
</li></ul><li>What are the worst cases? What constructs are unweildy, hard to read, write, or edit?
<ul>
<li>deeply nested loops or lists? repeated function applications?
</li>
<li>Are parts of the language &quot;write only&quot;?
</li></ul><li>How semanticaly dense is the syntax (on a scale of Java to APL)?
</li>
<li>Does the &quot;flow&quot; of an expression move cleanly left-to-right or right-to-left
<ul>
<li>Does the order that things happen match the order in which they would be read?
</li>
<li>personally it's a bit confusing when the first thing that happens is in the middle.
</li>
<li>like Endian-ness, but for expressions
</li></ul><li>Does your language use hard to type symbols (like APL)?
<ul>
<li>The symbols available on a keyboard are not standard across (natural) languages, and may make the (programming) language difficult to type with a non-QWERTY keyboard.
</li></ul><li>Which native types have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)">:literals</a>
</li>
<li>Is the grammar easy to parse?
<ul>
<li>The grammars should be straightforward and unambiguous for the computer to formally parse, but it also needs to easy to (informally) parse as a human reading code.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<h3>Embedded Domains</h3><p>
The core syntax of a language is usually composed of distinct clusters of syntax each handling a different subsystem in the language. Most of these can be omitted (as evidenced by lisp).
<p>
Common examples:
<ul>
<li>operators
<ul>
<li>boolean logic - comparison operators
</li>
<li>bit manipulation - usually in the main gammar
</li>
<li>basic math - math-consistent operator precedence usually
</li></ul><li>flow control
</li>
<li>type definitions
</li>
<li>function definitions
</li>
<li>variable assignments
</li>
<li>value literals
</li>
<li>indexing/slicing
</li>
<li>packing/unpacking arguments
</li>
<li>preprocessor/compile-time code blocks/quote/eval
</li>
<li>import/requires - often effectively declarative assertions about project structure, even in languages which are primarily imperative.
</li>
<li>exec - shell scripts like bash are almost entirely a syntax to invoke other commands
</li></ul><p>
What to include is a tradeoff of complexity and readability, and also has implications for the &quot;intended usecase&quot; of the language.
<p>
<h3>Value Embedded DSLs</h3><p>
Libraries usually define their own 'language' with which to discuss their domain, but do so in a way that only makes use of the general syntactic constructs for values, functions, types, etc. The DSLs discussed here are not of that nature.
Of interest here are embedded DSLs which impose additional syntactical constraints outside of the language's typical mode of parsing. Usually these DSLs are encoded as strings and parsed at runtime.
<p>
For example consider the difference between printf's format specifiers and python's f-strings. Because f-strings are a distinct literal form, they can be statically parsed and proved to be syntactically valid. Printf's format string on the other hand potentially hides structural unsound-ness until runtime.
<p>
More examples:
<ul>
<li>regex - usually encoded as a string
</li>
<li>format specifiers - printf (string) or python's f-strings (literal)
</li>
<li>cron spec - usually a string
</li>
<li>sql - usually a string, with markers for safe parameter injection
</li>
<li>documentation - often as a comment, but sometimes as strings (python's doc-string)
</li></ul><p>
Value embedded DSLs are a tradeoff between allowing more complete compile-time checks but adding complexity to the core grammar vs delegating to libraries but hiding code structure in values (usually strings).
Libraries that implement a value embedded DSL must duplicate the parsing, validation, and error reporting machinery that already exist in the core language. If the core language does not expose this machinery to libraries then handling will be inconsistent.

<h1>More Ideas for New Languages</h1><p>
Things I think would be interesting to have in a new language. Features big and small to serve as inspiration.
<p>
<ul>
<li>context free functions (pure, or only manipulating memory already exclusively allocated to that process) have only
    a single meta-algorithm, which is available throughout the whole stack.
<ul>
<li>the compiler should be aware if someone effectively reimplements a algorithm by hand and warn them to use the standard version
</li>
<li>The same thing could be implemented multiple times. Readable (but not performant) versions should be left in 
        so they can be available for the book/learning version.
</li>
<li>competing ways of doing the same task should be maintained, especially if they prioritize competing performance metrics.
        They can be tested for correctness against each other, and context aware compilation can pick one over the other.
</li></ul><li>top-level applications mark which functions a human user will be waiting on (real-time, human-facing IO) versus functions
    on which performance is not hyper noticeable.
<ul>
<li>this allows meta-algorithms to experiment with various implementations in contexts where no one will notice to gather real performance statistics
        on the current context.
</li>
<li>real performance statistics are used to find the optimal algorithm to apply in the human-facing scenario
</li>
<li>this optimization / recompilation happens in the background
</li></ul><li>truly DAG filesystems or tag based systems
<ul>
<li>use 'everything is a file' paradigm to expose dag query api
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<ul>
<li>strong separation between persistent state and intermediate representations
<ul>
<li>what if we handle persistence as a type property?
</li>
<li>strong separation between state transitions and data transformations
</li>
<li>state transitions <-> state <-> transformations <-> IO
</li></ul><li>pure functions are semantically equivalent to (potentially infinite) immutable mappings from arguments to a value.
<ul>
<li>despite the equivalence, there are time/space performance tradeoffs between the two. Can the compiler choose between the two?
</li>
<li>Can this equivalence be reflected in syntax?
</li></ul><li>are zipped iterators synced or not? what are the applications of each
</li>
<li>deriving types from properties? Generics over properties?
</li>
<li><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2024-06-17-automap.html">function lifting</a> (APL, futhark) implicitly map over arguments of unexpected rank

<li>cpu, gpu, threaded, cloud compute
</li>
<li>suitable functions (based on length hints, access patterns, derived purity) should automatically be sent to the gpu
</li>
<li>for distributed compute, 
<ul>
<li>autogenerate networking security boundaries.
</li>
<li>encryption, networking, serialized data format, consistency, defunctionalization (serializing function objects safely)

</li>
<li>code blocks are equivalent to immediate anonymous functions.
<ul>
<li>variables that are accessed in the block are parameters, variables that are set are return values.

<li>rust &quot;eliminated&quot; memory safety errors, what's the next class of errors to be swept away?
</li>
<li>Can a single language be simple enough at its core to compile it by hand (a la. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMG_(language)">Ken Thompson's great story</a>) but that can meta-program itself well enough to be viable on all levels of the stack?

<ul>
<li>regex
</li>
<li>sql queries
</li>
<li>these are used as special form literal values, but cannot be checked by the type system because the cast from string is usually implemented by a library

<h1>Other Thoughts</h1><p>
<h3>compunomicon</h3><p>
I've been obsessing lately over the idea that there's no good reason why there is more than a single implementation of sort present on a single computer.
Why is it that we need sort implemented in C, python, javascript, etc. each with a (potentially) different and arbitrary choice of algorithm?
<p>
<p>
I'm imagining a hyper-monolith that is compiler, operating system, scripting language, browser, and javascript all in one.
It would run on desktops, tablets, super-computers, smartphones, and micro-controllers. It's meta-algorithms would select
the appropriate way to sort given what it knows about its resource constraints, and the data it is sorting.
<p>
The data it collects on what is sorted, how often and how much, would be compiled. It would know its own strengths and weaknesses.
This data can be used tune the meta-algorithm. Perhaps that tuning would inform the next generation of chip design.
The monolith can compile real world performance analytics into verilog, to produce a chip that will perform faster.
<p>
The monolith generates its own documentation from its own source with the right flag.
<p>
I believe all the pieces exist, in one form or another. The only question is if they all fit together in a useful shape.
<p>
<h3>computer literacy</h3><p>
the day everyone has a basic understanding of computing we will see a fundamental shift in our society similar to the shift seen in preliterate to literate societies.
It think it may be useful to develop a lingua franca for this situation while we have the opportunity.
<p>
<h1>:x fractal</h1><p>
the same ideas recur, with varying levels of sophistication, in widely different contexts.
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication">IPC</a> is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">networking</a>.
<p>
ISAs are DSLs
<p>
everything turing complete is equivalent.
<p>
The browser is a desktop environment with better ergonomics for how it installs programs (websites are turing complete after all)
<p>
Caching happens in the processor (from memory), in memory (from the disk), in the disk (from the network) and in the CDN (from the site).
If a program can be programmatically re-installed or updated when needed, how is that different than a cached web resource?
Even a compiled binary could be considered a cache of the source (again if it could be dynamically recompiled when needed).
<p>
compilation and compression are intimately linked.
