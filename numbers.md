## :Do the natural numbers exist?
Is it possible for an intelligent alien species to not have the concept of counting?

Numbers are useful because the natural world organizes itself fractally, with many repetitions of things which (though unique in an absolute sense) are similar enough to each other to be fungible to the human.

At an abstract level, an apple is the same as any other apple even though, each apple is [:unique](#apple) on the absolute level. At the abstract level, you can say that there is more than one' 'apple', and *BOOM* you've got counting.

The idea of [:natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) follows pretty directly from the needs of a living organism to extract the relevant qualities from the [:objects](#objects) around them.

What appears to be repetitive in fact cannot be so in reality, only in the abstract.
The more abstract a label, the more often it will seem repeat, and the less precisely it will describe whatever it is applied to. The most abstract label can be applied to anything, yet specifies nothing about it (this may or may not be useful).

## : Does zero exist?
TODO (i.e. no, not yet)

## : Do negative numbers exist?
TODO (i.e. no, not yet)

## : Do imaginary numbers exist?
TODO (i.e. no, not yet)

# :x apple
This can happen because 'apple' is an abstract label that does not capture every characteristic of the 'apple' to which it refers;
there may be variations in color, or size but the label still applies.
# :x objects
'objects' themselves are not really a discrete thing. An apple is offgassing chemicals constantly, and the atmosphere diffuses into it. It is only conceptually distinct from its surroundings.
Is a rotted apple still an apple?
Is a chewed and digested apple still an apple?
Is an apple seed an apple?
The 'apple-ness' is not a physical thing that exists
