From Tibetan Buddhism, single-pointed concentration or samahi is the ability to keep the attention on an object for a 
great length of time with little to noo effort. It is associated with a particular clarity and ecstasy where the object 
and observer seem to join as one. It is also known as meditative absorption.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<p>
The practice used to develop samadhi is a visualization where attention is held on a single object or image. Consistency
is key. The object shouldn't be changed and should preferably have some spiritual significance. Traditionally the object is
the 'spacious nature of mind' but this object tends to be more difficult. The reason it is used is because it leads to a
 later realization in the tradition on emptiness.

description by Geshe La:
Sit comfortably and purify the mind with nine round breathing. Sit and observe thoughts as they arise. Thoughts do not 
last forever so they will end, even with no effort on your part. So let themn pass, and notice the space between.
What is left when there are no more thoughts? This is the true nature of mind. Thoughts are of the mind, but they are not
its entirety. The space in between is not senselessness, but pure awareness. Sustain for effect.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_faults_and_eight_antidotes">five obstacles and eight antidotes</a>
five obstacles to practice:
<ol>
<li>laziness: the lack of will to continue practice
<ul>
<li>lesser antidote: contemplate the benefits of samahdi. Achieving this would allow for unheard of productivity and
        make every other mental pursuit easier. Also it supposedly allows you to fly, read minds, see the future, walk 
        on water, and swim through the earth, etc. so that's cool
</li>
<li>greater antidote: experiencing the joy first hand so that practice becomes fun and easy to do.
</li></ul><li>Forgetfulness: losing the object of concentration
<ul>
<li>antidote: use an external image as an aid until you can recall all of its features. Do net worry about clarity in
    the beginning. If the memory fades, force it back.
</li></ul><li>agitation and depression: forcing the mind into an unfamiliar position can cause a drain or wandering of mental energy.

<h3>attention training technique</h3><p>
a meditative technique that comes from metacognitive therapy. MCT is intended to combat anxiety and depression. This
technique is specifically for training the focus such that it can be directed at will, being less scattered or fixated.
 It has had some clinical success but needs more studies to be widely accepted.
<p>
<ol>
<li>first pick an environment with multiple overlapping ambient noises or put on a recording.
</li>
<li>Isolate each sound in turn focusing on it to the exclusion of all else for 5 min. this is called selective attention
</li>
<li>focus on each sound one at a time and switch focus fairly rapidly for 5 min. This is attention switching
</li>
<li>take in the entire soundscape. try to hear all the sounds at once for 2 min. this is divided attention
</li></ol><p>
<h2>other</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>embrace boredom to train attention
<ul>
<li>treat it like an information diet. Eating well one day a week will not make you healthy
</li>
<li>take breaks from focus rather than breaks from distraction. Mindfulness should become the default. scheduled distractions and structured serendipity
</li>
<li>strict application is more effective
</li>
<li>one strategy is to severly limit and structure the time allotted to a goal. work at the cognitive limit to train for intensity
</li>
<li>use cognitive downtime, when you are occupied physically but not mentally as a productive meditation
<ul>
<li>return always to the problem considered, avoid thought loops
</li>
<li>structure the meditation by asking next-step questions and noting answers
</li></ul><li>attention training is a side effect of memory work also
</li></ul><li>quit social media
<ul>
<li>investigate and ruthlessly drop low value behaviors using the craftsman's approach to tools: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your life.
        adopt a tool only if its positive impact on those factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts
</li>
<li>in an information economy, anything that requires your attention can be considered a tool: entertainment, infotainment and social media
</li>
<li>everything aids your core goals
</li>
<li>focus on a few top level goals because of pareto's law
</li>
<li>use 'packing parties' to cut down on literal and metaphorical junk
</li>
<li>put thought into your leisure time, don't rely on infotainment
<ul>
<li>structured relaxation is just as refreshing
