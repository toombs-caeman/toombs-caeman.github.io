# The Deck of Many (mini) Games

The deck of many games is a collection of tabletop games written on blank playing cards with sharpie, because I [thought it would be cool](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4617-deck-of-many-things).

In order to be included the game should:
* be fun
* use only common game items (playing cards, d6, pencil & paper)
* fit on a playing card (~25 characters on ~10 lines). Ideally these condensed rules should be enough for someone who has never played before to guess at how to play "correctly".

My goal is to collect 52 such games

# Fishbowl
<pre>
Each player creates 1-3
phrases to put in a hat.
Two teams alternate
every minute guessing
until empty for 3 rounds
1 words from phrase taboo
2 use only 1 word
3 use only gestures
</pre>
# Balderdash
<pre>
Each player picks random
wikipedia article, reads
then writes the title.
A guesser randomly picks
one and has the others
say what it's about or
bluff. Guess the real one
1 pt for guessing right
1 pt for getting picked
unless the guesser's right
</pre>


# Farkle

There are a few scoring variations. I've written the version my family plays.
