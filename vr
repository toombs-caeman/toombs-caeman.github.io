<h1>VR</h1>
<p>
<h2>The Treadmill Problem</h2>
given that there is an absolute threshold of force perception, there is some small acceleration
which could be applied to a person's body such that they will never be able to perceive it.
<p>
Humans have some maximum acceleration their bodies can safely experience and, a much lower max acceleration
that they can generate with their own bodies over a sustained period.
<p>
Given this, and proper audio/visual/tactile feedback, it is possible for a human to be 
placed on a finite omni-directional treadmill which the human would never be able to escape,
nor would they be able to perceive that they are not moving in an unrestricted space.
<p>
This means that 'perfect' VR is possible in a finite space.
