# Learning Math
I did well in school math (up through calculus) but as with most things, school ruined a subject which I should have loved.
I've since forgotten most of calculus, and learned only informally those parts of math and formal logic most directly applicable to programming.

Now, I am still interested in diving deeper into maths, but I have limited time. I want to collect those presentations of ideas that I find particularly informative and beautiful here.
What is a beautiful presentation of math? Why is maths sometimes beautiful and othertimes tedious and dry? I don't have a good answer, but you know it when you see it.

I don't necessarily want to dive into every topic in depth. Hopefullly there exists an elegant framing for each topic that shows when and why someone should care about it. If I can find that, then that's where I'll stop until I have a reason to go deeper. There is magic in knowing the name of things and when to call on them, even if you don't intimately know the thing itself.

# other questions
* when you read a proof, how do you distinguish the parts which are mechanical and the parts which are insightful? Intuitive leaps need to be bridged by rigorous logic for it to be a valid proof, but where does the leap come from in the first place? Is the "insight" preserved in a beautiful presentation of the proof?
